## Error message "This installation package could not be opened. Contact the Application vendor to verify that this is a valid windows installer package"

**Problem:**

**Error message "This installation package could not be opened. Contact the Application vendor to verify that this is a valid windows installer package"**

**Reason:**

There are two possible reasons for this error to happen:

* The installation file got corrupt during the download

* The installation file was downloaded to a compressed folder and/or the temp folder on the machine is compressed

**Suggested solution:**

Log in to your Telerik account and download the Telerik® UI for ASP.NET AJAX installer again. An md5 hash sum calculator can be used to verify the new download is not corrupt (the [fciv](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/841290/) utility is such a tool). Download the installation file to a non-compressed drive.

## "Installation Error" screen during the installation

**Problem:**

**"Installation Error" screen during the installation.**

**Reason:**

The installer has encountered an unexpected error during the execution. The error could be caused by a circumstance on the particular machine.

**Suggested solution:**

Run the installation with logging enabled and send the log file via a support ticket for analysis. The log file helps detecting the problem quicker. You'll get either a suggestion on how to fix the problem, or the installer will be fixed. To start the installer with logging enabled, please, follow the steps below:

* Open a command prompt;

* Navigate to the folder, where the Telerik® UI for ASP.NET AJAX installer is located;

* Run the following command:`msiexec /i [ControlsInstallation.msiFileName] /limev Telerik.Web.UI.Install.log`



*Identified occurrences:*

* The Visual Studio reset performed by the installer did not succeed. On some machines the `[VSInstallDir]\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe /setup` command fails when called by the installer (it might not fail when the command run directly from the command-line). Steps that could help avoid this problem:

	* Delete all files in the *[VSInstallDir]\Common7\IDE\ProjectTemplatesCache*
	
	* Delete all files in the *[VSInstallDir]\Common7\IDE\ItemTemplatesCache*
	
	* Start a Visual Studio instance and run the installer without closing it

	* run the *[VSInstallDir]\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe /setup* command manually

* The automatic installation of ASP.NET AJAX Extensions 1.0 (performed by the Telerik® UI for ASP.NET AJAX installer as a prerequisite for the .NE 2.0 assemblies) did not succeed. The workaround is to download [ASP.NET AJAX 1.0](https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=ca9d90fa-e8c9-42e3-aa19-08e2c027f5d6&displaylang=en) and install it manually. Run the Telerik® UI for ASP.NET AJAX installer afterwards.
