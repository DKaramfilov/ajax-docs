# Controlling Appearance

## 

There are a number of ways you can customize the look & feel of your **RadToolBar** control:

* To change the overall look and feel of the toolbar, set the [Skin]({%slug toolbar/appearance-and-styling/skins%}) property.

* To change the look of an individual button in the toolbar, including reflecting the button's state, [use a CSS class property]({%slug toolbar/appearance-and-styling/setting-the-css-class-of-buttons%}).

* Use the properties of the individual buttons to [add images]({%slug toolbar/appearance-and-styling/adding-images-to-buttons%}).

* Use [templates]({%slug toolbar/templates/overview%}) to substitute controls for the toolbar buttons.

* Turn buttons into [separators]({%slug toolbar/appearance-and-styling/separators%}) to manage the layout of drop-down lists.

* Use [Animations]({%slug toolbar/appearance-and-styling/animations%}) to customize the appearance of drop-down lists when they expand and contract.

* Set the **Orientation** property to specify whether the toolbar is horizontal or vertical.

* Use the **dir="rtl"** attribute to give the toolbar a [right-to-left orientation]({%slug toolbar/appearance-and-styling/rtl-support%}).
