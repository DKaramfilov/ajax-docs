__RadToolBar__ supports a number of server-side events that let you respond to events with complex actions that can't be performed in client-side code.

* [ButtonClick]({%slug toolbar/server-side-programming/buttonclick%}) occurs when a button is clicked.

* [ButtonDataBound]({%slug toolbar/server-side-programming/buttondatabound%}) occurs for each button when it is being bound to a data value.

* [ItemCreated]({%slug toolbar/server-side-programming/itemcreated%}) occurs when a new item is added to the Items collection.
