# Understanding the Skin CSS File



Styles for RadControls are defined using Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) syntax. Each style consists of a selector that identifies an HTML element to be styled, and property/value pairs that describe each of the style specifics, e.g. color, padding, margins, etc. For example, the ".RadPanelBar_Default" style shown below loads the background image that is used for every item in a panel bar with the "Default" skin:

````CSS
.RadPanelBar_Default { 
    background: #5c5c5c url('PanelBar/background.gif') repeat-x bottom center;
}
````



See the [CSS Skin FileSelectors]({%slug panelbar/appearance-and-styling/css-skin-file-selectors%}) topic for more information on the specific CSS selectors used for **RadPanelBar** skins.

Each style maps to a "class" attribute in an HTML tag. For example, consider the excerpt from the HTML rendering of a panel bar shown below:

````ASPNET
<div id="RadPanelBar1" class="RadPanelBar RadPanelBar_Default ">
    <ul class="rpRootGroup">
        <li class="rpItem rpFirst"><a href="#" class="rpLink rpExpandable"><span class="rpText">
            One</span> </a>
            <div class="rpSlide">
                <ul class="rpGroup rpLevel1 ">
                    <li class="rpItem rpFirst"><a href="#" class="rpLink rpExpandable"><span class="rpText">
                        i</span> </a>
                        <div class="rpSlide">
                            <ul class="rpGroup rpLevel2 ">
                                ...
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    ...
                </ul>
            </div>
        </li>
        ...
    </ul>
    <input id="RadPanelBar1_ClientState" name="RadPanelBar1_ClientState" type="hidden" />
</div>
````



The control is rendered as a DIV element with the class "**RadPanelBar RadPanelBar_Default**". Each level of items in the hierarchy is rendered as another DIV element nested within the main DIV. The items at a level are rendered as an unordered list, where each list element is a item.

Here is a more detailed breakdown of the rendered markup:

## Root tag

The panel bar is rendered as a **DIV** tag. Here is an excerpt from the example above:

````ASPNET
<div id="RadPanelBar1" class="RadPanelBar RadPanelBar_Default ">
    <!-- content goes here -->
</div>
````



The **ID** attribute of the DIV tag is set to the **ClientID** property of the **RadPanelBar** control. As you can see, two CSS classes have been applied: "**RadPanelBar**" and "**RadPanelBar_Default**". The "**RadPanelBar**" class is always applied. It defines the basic presentation of the panel bar which is common for all skins. The "**RadPanelBar_Default**" class is applied because the **Skin** of the panel bar is set to **"Default"**. If the panel bar had a right-to-left orientation, two additional classes would be applied: "**RadPanelBar_Default_rtl**" and "**rpRtl**".

If you set the **Style** or **CssClass** property of the **RadPanelBar** control they would be applied to the DIV tag as well:

````ASPNET
<telerik:radpanelbar runat="server" id="RadPanelBar1" skin="Default" cssclass="MyPanelBar"
    style="position: relative; z-index: 1000">
				
````



## Root level items

The root level items are rendered as an unordered list (UL) where each item is a list item (LI):

````ASPNET
	     
<ul class="rpRootGroup">
 <li class="rpItem rpFirst">
   <!-- first item content -->
 </li>
 <li class="rpItem">
   <!-- second item content -->
 </li>
 <li class="rpItem rpLast">
   <!-- last item content -->
 </li>
</ul> 
				
````



The UL element for the root items has the "**rpRootGroup**" class applied. The LI for each item has the "**rpItem**" class applied. In addition, the first item has the "**rpFirst**" class applied and the last element has the "**rpLast**" class applied.

If an item acts as a separator, it has the "**rpSeparator**" class applied to the LI element.

## Child groups

Groups of child items (which are rendered nested inside the content of the parent item), have a similar structure to the root level items:

````ASPNET
	     
<div class="rpSlide">
 <ul class="rpGroup rpLevel1 ">
   <li class="rpItem rpFirst">
     <!-- content of first child -->
   </li>
   <li class="rpItem">
     <!-- content of middle child -->
   </li>
   <li class="rpItem rpLast">
     <!-- content of last child -->
   </li>
 </ul>
</div>
	
				
````



The entire group is rendered as a DIV element with the "**rpSlide**" class applied. This is used for animated effects, and can be ignored for purposes of styling the panel bar.

Inside the DIV element is a UL element, similar to the one for the root group, but with the "**rpGroup**" class applied instead of "**rpRootGroup**". In addition, a class identifying the level is applied. In the example above, this is "**rpLevel1**". For level two items, it is "**rpLevel2**", and so on. If you set the **ChildGroupCssClass** property of the parent item, this is the element that gets that class applied.

The items themselves are rendered in exactly the same way as root level items.

## Item content

Inside the LI element for each child, an item is rendered as an A element, along with a DIV element if the item has a template assigned, and another DIV if the item has child items:

````ASPNET
	     	
<li class="rpItem">
 <a href="#" class="rpLink rpExpandable">
   <img alt="" src="images/panel_First.gif" class="rpImage" />
   <span class="rpText">i</span>
 </a>
 <div class="rpTemplate">
   <!-- template content here -->
 </div>
 <div class="rpSlide">
   <ul class="rpGroup rpLevel2 ">
      <!-- next level child items here -->
   </ul>
 </div>
</li> 
				
````



The A element for the item has the "**rpLink**" class applied. If the item has child items, it also gets the "**rpExpandable**" class applied (when it is unexpanded) or the "**rpExpanded**" class applied if it is expanded. If the item is selected, this element gets the "**rpSelected**" class applied. If the item is disabled, it gets the "**rpDisabled**" class applied. When clicked, it gets the "**rpClicked**" class applied. When it has focus, it gets the "**rpFocused**" class. This is also the element that gets any class assigned to the **CssClass** property of the item.

Inside the A element for an item, the image and text of the item are rendered as IMG and SPAN elements. The image gets the "**rpImage**" class applied, and the SPAN gets the "**rpText**" class applied.

If the item has a template, this is rendered as a DIV element with the "**rpTemplate**" class assigned, which follows the A element for the item.

## Separators

Separators are rendered similarly to other elements, but without the A element, because they do not respond to user actions:

````ASPNET
	     
<li class="rpItem rpSeparator">
 <span class="rpText"><hr></span>
</li> 
				
````
