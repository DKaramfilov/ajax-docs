# RadPanelBar Item Builder



The **RadPanelBar Item Editor** lets you populate your panel bar with a hierarchy of items that do not come from a separate data source. There are three ways to bring up the RadPanelBar Item Editor:

* From the **RadPanelBar**[ Smart Tag ]({%slug panelbar/design-time/smart-tag%}), click on the **Build RadPanelBar** link.

* Right-click on the **RadPanelBar** component and select **Build RadPanelBar** from its context menu.

* In the Properties pane, with **RadPanelBar** selected, click on the ellipsis button next to the **Items** property.

The **RadPanelBar Item Editor** lets you add, rearrange, configure, and delete panel items. These actions are initiated using the tool bar at the upper left of the Item editor:

The following table describes the controls in the tool bar:

|  **Button**  |  **Function**  |
| ------ | ------ |
|![Panelbar Add Root Item](images/panelbar_addrootitem.png)|Adds a root item to the panel bar in the next available position. Root items are the top-level items (panel items with no parent item).|
|![Add Child Item](images/panelbar_addchilditem.png)|Adds a child item to the currently selected panel item. The child can belong to either a root item or another child item.|
|![Delete Item](images/panelbar_deleteitem.png)|Deletes the currently selected panel item. When you delete a panel item, its child items are deleted as well.|
|![Make Sibling To Parent](images/panelbar_makesiblingtoparent.png)|Moves the currently selected panel item up a level, making it a sibling to its parent item (following the parent item).|
|![Make Child Of Preceding Sibling](images/panelbar_makechildofprecedingsibling.png)|Moves the currently selected panel item down a level, making it the child of its previous sibling.|
|![Move Before Sibling](images/panelbar_movebeforesibling.png)|Moves the currently selected panel item backward in its current list of siblings, so that it precedes the previous sibling.|
|![Move After Sibling](images/panelbar_moveaftersibling.png)|Moves the currently selected panel item forward in its current list of siblings, so that it follows the next sibling.|

When a panel item (either a root item or a child item) is selected, the properties pane on the right of the **RadPanelBar Item Editor** lets you configure the item by setting its properties. For each item,

* **Text** is the text of the item as it appears in the panel bar.

* **ToolTip** is the text of a tooltip that appears when the user hovers the mouse over the item.

* **Enabled** controls whether the item is initially enabled or disabled.

* **IsSeparator** specifies whether the panel item [acts as a separator]({%slug panelbar/appearance-and-styling/separators%}).

* **Expanded** specifies whether the item is initially expanded.

* **PreventCollapse** specifies whether the user can collapse the item once it is expanded.

* **Selected** specifies whether the item is initially selected.

* **Value** lets you associate a text value with the panel item that you can use when programming the panel bar behavior.

* **NavigateUrl** and **Target** cause the panel item to automatically launch another Web page (specified by **NavigateUrl**) in the window specified by **Target**. If the **Target** property is not set, the new Web page uses the current browser window.

* **PostBack** specifies whether the item causes a postback.

* **CssClass**, **ClickedCssClass**, **DisabledCssClass**, **ExpandedCssClas**, and **FocusedCssClass** [control the appearance of the panel item]({%slug panelbar/appearance-and-styling/setting--the-css-class-of-items%}) when it is in its normal state, clicked, disabled, expanded, and holds input focus, respectively.

* **ImageUrl**, **SelectedImageUrl**, **DisabledImageUrl**, **ExpandedImageUrl**, and **HoveredImageUrl** let you [specify an image]({%slug panelbar/appearance-and-styling/adding-images-to-items%}) that appears on the left of the panel item when it is in its normal state, clicked, disabled, expanded, and when the mouse hovers over it, respectively.

* **ImagePosition** specifies the position of the image in the panel item.
