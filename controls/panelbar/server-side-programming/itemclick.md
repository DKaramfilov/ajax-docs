# ItemClick



## 

The server-side **ItemClick** event occurs when the user clicks on a panel item, causing a postback.

The **ItemClick** event handler receives two arguments:

1. The **RadPanelBar** that contains the clicked item. This argument is of type object, but can be cast to the **RadPanelBar** type.

1. A **RadPanelBarEventArgs** object. This object has an **Item** property that you can use to access the item that was clicked.

Use the **ItemClick** event handler to respond when the user clicks an item in the panel bar.



````C#
	
protected void RadPanelBar1_ItemClick(object sender, RadPanelBarEventArgs e) 
{ 
    RadPanelItem ItemClicked = e.Item; Response.Write("Server event raised -- you clicked: " + ItemClicked.Text); 
}
	
````
````VB.NET
