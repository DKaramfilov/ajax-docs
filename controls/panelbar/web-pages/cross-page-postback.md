# Cross-Page Postback



## 

You can have your panel bar cause postbacks to a different Web page from the one that contains it. Simply set the **PostBackUrl** property to the page that should handle the postback.

````ASPNET
<telerik:radpanelbar 
	id="RadPanelBar1" runat="server" 
	onitemclick="RadPanelBar1_ItemClick"
	postbackurl="CrossPage.aspx">
	<Items > 
		... 
	</Items >
</telerik:radpanelbar>
````



Once in the second page, you can access the the panel bar (or any other control) on the previous page using the **Page.PreviousPage** property.



````C#
	
public partial class CrossPageCS : XhtmlPage 
{ 
	protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
	{ 
		if (Page.PreviousPage == null) 
		{ 
			Response.Redirect("Default.aspx"); 
		} 
		RadPanelBar pb = (RadPanelBar)Page.PreviousPage.FindControl("RadPanelBar1");
	} 
}
	
````
````VB.NET
	
Partial Class CrossPageVB  Inherits System.Web.UI.Page
    Protected Sub Page_Load(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs) Handles Me.Load
        If Page.PreviousPage Is Nothing Then
            Response.Redirect("Default.aspx")

        End If
        Dim pb As RadPanelBar
        pb = CType(Page.PreviousPage.FindControl("RadPanelBar1"), RadPanelBar)
    End Sub
End Class
	
````


>tip Another way to perform cross-page postbacks is to set the **NavigateUrl** property of **RadPanelItem** controls in you panel bar.
