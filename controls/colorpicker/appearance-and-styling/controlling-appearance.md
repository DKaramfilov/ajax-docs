# Controlling Appearance




There are a number of ways you can customize the look & feel of the color picker:

* To change the overall look and feel of the tooltip, set the [Skin]({%slug colorpicker/appearance-and-styling/skins%}) property.

* Adjust the [Width]({%slug colorpicker/functionality/width%}) and [Columns]({%slug colorpicker/functionality/columns%}) properties.

* [Display the color picker as an icon]({%slug colorpicker/functionality/show-as-icon%}).

* [Hide and display empty color and preview areas]({%slug colorpicker/functionality/hiding-and-displaying-color-picker-elements%}).
