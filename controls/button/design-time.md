# Design Time

The Smart Tag of **RadButton** (**Figure 1**) lets you configure your control or quickly get help. You can display the Smart Tag by right clicking on a **RadButton** control and choosing "Show Smart Tag", or clicking the small rightward-pointing arrow located in the upper right corner of the control.

As of Q2 2015 we have improved the smart tags of our controls by displaying the most popular control specific properties and adding links to their important online resources:
