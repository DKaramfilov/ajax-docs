# Common Issues

This topic describes some of the possible issues with RadFileExplorer and how to deal with them

## Upload or Delete commands are disabled

Make sure that *UploadPaths* or *DeletePaths* properties are set correctly

## Setting a path to the InitialPath property does not select folder or file

Make sure that the path set to the property has the same format as the path shown in the RadFileExplorer's address bar. This is required in order to provide unambiguous paths for any content provider.

The provided path must point to a concrete file that is present in the currently shown file list (i.e., in the current folder). If you point the control to a folder that is not yet opened, it cannot navigate to the desired file, because the file list is obtained via a separate request only after the folder is shown to the client, so the control does not know whether the desired file exists yet.

## An error like "... because the application did not have enough permissions..." occurs only in a production environment. How to debug the issue?

* Remove the RadFileExplorer (or all Telerik controls) from the page

* In the code behind of the same page where the RadFileExplorer was declared add this code:


````C#
protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
	string[] paths = new string[] { "~/RootDirectory1/" };// Path to test

	//RadFileExplorer1.Configuration.ViewPaths = paths;
	//RadFileExplorer1.Configuration.DeletePaths = paths;
	//RadFileExplorer1.Configuration.UploadPaths = paths;

	FullPermissionsTest(Server.MapPath(paths[0]));// Pass physical path
}


/// <summary>
/// Full permission test
/// </summary>
/// <param name="testPhysicalPath">Physical path</param>
private void FullPermissionsTest(string testPhysicalPath)
{
	try
	{
		string physicalPathToTestFolder = System.IO.Path.Combine(testPhysicalPath, "TestDirectory");
		System.IO.DirectoryInfo testDir = System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(physicalPathToTestFolder);// Create folder
		testDir.GetDirectories();// List folders
		string testFilePath = System.IO.Path.Combine(testDir.FullName, "TestFile1.txt");// test file paths
		System.IO.File.Create(testFilePath).Close();// Create a file
		testDir.GetFiles("*.*");// List files
		System.IO.File.OpenRead(testFilePath).Close();// Open a file
		System.IO.File.Delete(testFilePath);// delete the test file
		System.IO.Directory.Delete(physicalPathToTestFolder);// delete the test folder
	}
	catch (Exception ex)
	{// Show the probelm

		string message = ex.Message;
		string script = string.Format("alert('{0}');", message.Replace("'", @""""));
		ScriptManager.RegisterStartupScript(this.Page, this.Page.GetType(), "KEY", script, true);
	}
}
