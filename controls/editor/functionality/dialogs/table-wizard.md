# Table Wizard

The Table Wizard provides advanced features for creating and customizing tables in the editor's content area. The Table Wizard is a dialog with tabs for detailed table design: **Table Properties**, **Cell Properties**, **Table Layouts**  and **Accessibility**. The Table Wizard can be invoked using the **Insert Table Dropdown.**
