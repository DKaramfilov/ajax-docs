# Resize Dialogs

Due to designer requirements, the **RadEditor** dialogs should be resized to a non-default dimensions. The following article explains how the size of the built-in dialogs could be easily manipulated via the **DialogDefinition** class.

>caution As of the Q3 2013 release, setting a custom size for the built-in dialogs using the approach suggested in this article will not work as expected due to	improvements Telerik made to dialogs in **RadEditor** . You can find information about this subject in the ["The Autosize feature of the Built-in Dialogs is Enabled"]({%slug editor/changes-and-backwards-compatibility/the-autosize-feature-of-the-built-in-dialogs-is-enabled%}) article, in which an appropriate approach for resizing is also provided.

As shown in **Example 1**, the **DialogDefinition** class of **RadEditor** provides the ability to change the initial size of **RadEditor** dialogs in the	**Page_PreRenderComplete** event. For example, to increase the size of the **LinkManager** dialog you can get a reference to it with the **GetDialogDefinition** method of the **DialogDefinition** class and then use the **Width** and **Height** properties to set the desired dimension:

>caption Example 1: Resizing the **LinkManager** dialog via the **DialogDefinition** class.

````C#
protected override void OnInit(EventArgs e)
{
	base.OnInit(e);
	this.Page.PreRenderComplete += new EventHandler(Page_PreRenderComplete);
}
void Page_PreRenderComplete(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
	Telerik.Web.UI.DialogDefinition linkManager = RadEditor1.GetDialogDefinition("LinkManager");
	linkManager.Height = Unit.Pixel(500);
	linkManager.Width = Unit.Pixel(500);
}
````
````VB
Protected Overloads Overrides Sub OnInit(ByVal e As EventArgs)
	MyBase.OnInit(e)
	AddHandler Me.Page.PreRenderComplete, AddressOf Page_PreRenderComplete
End Sub

Sub Page_PreRenderComplete(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
	Dim linkManager As Telerik.Web.UI.DialogDefinition = RadEditor1.GetDialogDefinition("LinkManager")
	linkManager.Height = Unit.Pixel(500)
	linkManager.Width = Unit.Pixel(500)
End Sub
````


The **DialogDefinition** class also provides different useful **RadWidow** configuration settings such as **Behaviors**, **VisibleStatusbar**, **VisibleTitlebar**, etc.
