RadEditor offers two ways for creating tables. The best approach depends on your preferences and the table complexity:

* For simple tables we recommend the click-and-drag Table Builder 

* For more complex tables, the Table Wizard is more appropriate.

## Table Wizard

The Table Wizard provides advanced features for creating and customizing tables in the editor's content area. The Table Wizard is a dialog with tabs for detailed table design: **Table Properties, Cell Properties and Accessibility**. The Table Wizard can be invoked using the **Insert Table Dropdown**.

## Table Properties

This tab allows you to adjust the number of rows and columns as well as adjust the row and column span. You can also configure table dimensions and layout by setting one or more of the following table properties:
