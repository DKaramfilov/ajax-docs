# Creating Accessible Content Overview

## Creating Accessible Content ("Section 508"and WCAG2 compliant)

To generate content that can be interpreted by assistive technologies such as the Accessibility Tools integrated in Microsoft Windows (the Narrator, the Magnifier, and the On-Screen Keyboard), RadEditor includes additional fields in the Table, Hyperlink and Image dialogs.By making content Section 508 or WCAG2 compliant, it means that equivalent access to information is available for all users.
