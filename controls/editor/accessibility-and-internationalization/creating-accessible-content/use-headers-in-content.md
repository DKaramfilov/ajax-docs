# Use Headers in Content

If there is a large amount of text (over 750 characters) then headers make it much easier for all users to navigate through the content. You can see how to apply a heading in RadEditor in the Apply Paragraph Styles section in [RadEditor's End User Manual](https://www.telerik.com/documents/RadEditorAjaxEndUserManual.pdf), e.g.

Predefined paragraph styles are used to ease the process of formatting paragraphs. The user can apply consistent paragraph styles to a document. The predefined styles include different heading styles, and other styles defined by the developer. To apply a paragraph style to some text, first place the cursor within the text, then from the paragraph styles dropdown list, select the style you want to apply.
