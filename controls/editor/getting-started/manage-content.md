# Manage Content

1. [Mechanisms for enforcing user roles]({%slug editor/functionality/dialogs/examples/enforce-roles%}) (insert, upload, delete rights) - RadEditor for ASP.NET AJAX is built with security in mind to facilitate integration even in large enterprise-wide systems. This requires strict definition and enforcing of user roles. With Telerik RadEditor administrators have the ability to control insert, upload, and delete rights for images, Flash, Windows Media™, and documents.

1. [Templates]({%slug editor/functionality/dialogs/file-browser-dialogs/templates%}) - RadEditor for ASP.NET AJAX allows you to insert chunks of HTML code obtained from external files (e.g. pre-formatted tables signatures etc.) Those files are called Templates and can be in any format that your server will allow you to read (HTML, Text files, etc.) Templates are similar to code snippets with the only difference that they are obtained from individual files, which the user can browse, upload, delete, etc.

1. [Cleaning Word Formatting]({%slug editor/managing-content/pasting-content/clean-ms-word-formatting-%}) – RadEditor for ASP.NET AJAX introduces a number of features, which help the user paste formatted content from Microsoft Word and other applications, and apply different types of format stripping. Among the tools are: "Paste from Word cleaning Fonts and Sizes" button, "Paste as HTML" button, Word Content in Clipboard Interception, etc.

1. [Content Filters]({%slug editor/managing-content/content-filters%}) - these are small code snippets, which are called in a sequence to process the editor content, when the editor mode (html/design/preview) is changed. Basically, the editor content is supplied to the filter chain and each filter gets a chance to modify it.

1. [Enhanced Handling of Styles]({%slug editor/functionality/toolbars/dropdowns/css-styles%}) - a powerful algorithm for style handling has been introduced, which allows CSS styles to be applied very intelligently, without overlapping of tags.
