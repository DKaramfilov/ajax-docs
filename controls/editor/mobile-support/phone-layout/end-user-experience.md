This article shows some basic examples how the end user can interact with the phone-optimized RadEditor control:

* [Start Editing](#start-editing)

* [Using the Tools](#using-the-tools)

* [Using Tabs and Contextual Tabs](#using-tabs-and-contextual-tabs)

* [Toggling HTML Mode](#toggling-html-mode)

* [Using Built-in Mobile Dialogs](#using-built-in-mobile-dialogs)

	* [Hyperlink Manager](#hyperlink-manager)
	* [File Browser Dialogs](#file-browser-dialogs)
	* [Insert Table](#insert-table)
	* [Find and Replace](#find-and-replace)

 

## Start Editing

Initially, **RadEditor** is loaded in **Preview** mode (**Figure 1**). In order to start editing the content (full screen mode), the user should tap either the content, or the **Edit Content** button (![](./images/edit-contnet-button.png)).

In full screen mode, user can edit the text and operate with the header tools.

## Using the Tools

The **ToolZone** can be shown by pressing the **Toggle ToolZone** button from the Header Tools (![](./images/toggle-toolzone.png)). Using the tools will affect the current selection.

The animation in **Figure 4** shows how a user would be able to use the tools and edit or format the content.

## Using Tabs and Contextual Tabs

To change the current tab, the user should press the **Tab Chooser** button (![](./images/html-mode-button.png)). As shown in **Figure 5**, a pop-up with all available tabs will be shown. Tapping on one of them, will load the corresponding tools from this tab into the **ToolZone**.

Additionally, tabs can be configured to be shown only when a certain element is selected. This can be controlled via the **Context** property of the **EditorToolGroup** items. You can read more about that in the [Toolbar Configuration]({%slug editor/mobile-support/phone-layout/toolbar-configuration%}) article.

In **Figure 6**, you can see how selecting an `<img>` element in the content and opening the **ToolZone**, automatically shows the built-in **Image** tab.

## Toggling HTML Mode

The user can edit the content as HTML by switching to HTML mode. This is done by tapping  the **Toggle HTML** button (![](./images/html-mode-button.png)) from the header tools. This will show the content's HTML. Once user is done, tapping the same button will switch the mode back to Design.

## Using Built-in Mobile Dialogs

With the creation of the phone-optimized **RadEditor**, the built-in dialogs also have also been re-designed in order to expose a more user-friendly UI under phone devices. You can learn more details about how to configure the built-in dialogs in the [Mobile Dialogs]({%slug editor/mobile-support/phone-layout/dialogs%}) article.

The following sections explain the specific elements for each mobile dialog.

### Common Elements

All built-in dialogs have **OK**/**Insert** and **Cancel** buttons that are used to perform the dialog's action and to cancel the operation. With the mobile-optimized dialogs, these buttons are placed at the top toolbar of the dialog.
