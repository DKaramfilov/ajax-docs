# Use Themes

RadEditor can be configured to use **ASP.NET 2.0 Themes** in the same manner as ordinary asp.net controls. A theme can be shared among multiple editors to make group configuration extremely easy. This ensures that configuration of all editors is done from a single location.To use themes with RadEditor:

1. From the Solution Explorer, right-click the project and select **Add | Add ASP.NET Folder | App_Themes** from the context menu.

1. Right-click the **App_Themes** folder and select **Add | New Item** from the context menu. Select the **Skin File** item type.

1. Open the skin file and add the RadEditor page directive and declaration. Set the RadEditor **SkinId** property to a unique name. In the example below, SkinId is declared as "SettingProperties".

	**ASP.NET**
	
		<%@ register tagprefix="telerik" namespace="Telerik.Web.UI" assembly="Telerik.Web.UI" %>
		<telerik:radeditor runat="server" SkinId="SettingProperties" Width="500" Height="500">
			<content>       
				<b>Setting inline properties</b> 
			</content>
		</telerik:radeditor>

1. In the ASPX/ASCX where the skin will be used, set the Theme in the page declaration. In the example below, the **Theme** is declared as "Theme1" to match the contents of App_Themes.

	**ASP.NET**
		
		<%@ page language="C#" autoeventwireup="true" codebehind="Default.aspx.cs" theme="Theme1"
			inherits="prometheusRadEditor001._Default" %>


1. In the RadEditor declaration, set the **SkinId** property to match the skin file created earlier. In the example below, SkinID is set to "SettingProperties" to match the **SkinId** declared in the skin file earlier.

	**ASP.NET**
	
		<telerik:RadEditor RenderMode="Lightweight" ID="RadEditor1" SkinID="SettingProperties" runat="server">
		</telerik:RadEditor>


>caution The controls form the Telerik® UI for ASP.NET AJAX suite in general and the editor control in specific, have both a **Skin** and **SkinID** Properties. **SkinID** refers to the general theming mechanism introduced in ASP.NET 2.0 and applies to standard ASP.NET controls, such as asp:Button. The **Skin** property refers to the Telerik® UI for ASP.NET AJAX **-** specific theming mechanism and allows you to set a number of CSS styles to a Telerik control at one time.
