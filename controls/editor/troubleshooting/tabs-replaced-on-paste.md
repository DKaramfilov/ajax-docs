# TABs Replaced on Paste



## 

PROBLEM 

When cutting and pasting tabbed text from Word into Telerik RadEditor, it replaces all the tabs with a series of `&nbsp;`.

REASON

In HTML, there is no equivalent of the TAB character. Word uses special characters for TAB which are not recognized by the browser.
