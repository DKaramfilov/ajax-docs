# Events

For a detailed list with the server-side properties and methods of the control, see the [Server-Side API of the RadMenu class](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/api/server/Telerik.Web.UI/RadMenu).

## 

**RadMenu** introduces three server-side events for working with menu items:

* [ItemClick]({%slug menu/server-side-programming/itemclick%}) occurs when the user clicks on a menu item.

* [ItemCreated]({%slug menu/server-side-programming/itemcreated%}) occurs when a new menu item is added to the menu (at any level).

* [ItemDataBound]({%slug menu/server-side-programming/itemdatabound%}) occurs when a menu item is bound to a data source.
