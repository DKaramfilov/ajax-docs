# Optimizing RadMenu Performance

When using RadMenu control you may experience an performance issue if you load many items in it. Nevertheless, the control supports [web service load on demand](https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/Menu/Examples/Programming/WebService/DefaultCS.aspx) and lazy initialization (transparent for the user). Additionally it can seamlessly work with disabled ViewState.
