# CDN



## Links to web resources are non-secure although the page is requested through SSL

### Cause:

In certain cases, e.g. the web server is behind a load balancer, which is the SSL endpoint, the generated links to the web resources are non-secure. (SSL terminates on the load balancer and the web server receives a non-secure request, so it generates non-secure links.)

### Solution:

In these cases, a solution is to force secure links by setting the **BaseUrl** property to the value of the **BaseSecureUrl**. There are three alternative ways of doing this (identically applicable to **RadStyleSheetManager**):

* 

````XML
<appsettings>  
	<add key="Telerik.ScriptManager.TelerikCdn.BaseUrl" value="https://my.favorite.cdn"  />   
</appsettings>
````



* 

````XML
<telerik:RadScriptManager 
	ID="RadScriptManager1" 
	runat="server">
	<CdnSettings TelerikCdn="Enabled" 
		BaseUrl="https://my.favorite.cdn" />
</telerik:RadScriptManager>
````



* 



````C#
	
protected void Page_Init(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
	RadScriptManager1.CdnSettings.BaseUrl = RadScriptManager1.CdnSettings.BaseSecureUrl;
}
	
````
````VB.NET
	
Protected Sub Page_Init(sender As Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles Me.Init
	RadScriptManager1.CdnSettings.BaseUrl = RadScriptManager1.CdnSettings.BaseSecureUrl
End Sub
	
	#End Region
	
	End Class
````
