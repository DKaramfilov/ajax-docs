# Events Overview



## 

**RadWizard** provides a rich set of client-side events which allow easy and flexible use in a wide range of application scenarios. In this article you will find examples about each of these events, demonstrating how to handle and cancel them (if possible):

* **[OnClientLoad]({%slug wizard/client-side-programming/events/load%})**—raised when the **RadWizard** client-side object is fully loaded. The full API of the control is available at this point.

* **[OnClientButtonClicking]({%slug wizard/client-side-programming/events/buttonclicking%})**—raised when user clicks on a button or step before the **RadWizard** responds to the click. You can handle this event in case you want to prevent the click.

* **[OnClientButtonClicked]({%slug wizard/client-side-programming/events/buttonclicked%})**—raised occurs immediately after the **RadWizard** responds to button or step click.
