# Understanding the Skin CSS File

Styles for Telerik controls are defined using Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) syntax. Each style consists of a selector that identifies an HTML element to be styled, and property/value pairs that describe each of the style specifics, e.g. color, padding, margins, etc. For example, the ".RadSplitter_Default .resizeBarOverHorizontal" style defines the color of a split bar when the mouse hovers over it:

````CSS    
.RadSplitter_Default .resizeBarOverHorizontal
{ 
	background: #383838;
}				
````

See the [CSS Skin File Selectors]({%slug splitter/appearance-and-styling/css-classes%}) topic for more information on the specific CSS selectors used for **RadSplitter** skins. You can see custom styles applied in the screenshot below:

Each style maps to a "class" attribute in an HTML tag. For example, consider the HTML rendering of a horizontal **RadSplitter** control such as the one shown above:

````HTML	     
<div id="RadSplitter1" >
 <table id="RAD_SPLITTER_RadSplitter1" class="RadSplitter_Green" ...>
   <tr id="RAD_SPLITTER_PANE_TR_RadPane1">
	 <td id="RadPane1" valign="top" class="paneHorizontal firstItem" ...>
	   <div id="RAD_SPLITTER_PANE_CONTENT_RadPane1"  style="height:80px;overflow:auto;">
		 ...
	   </div>
	   <input id="RadPane1_ClientState" ... />
	 </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
	 <td id="RadSplitBar1" class="resizeBarHorizontal" ...>
	   <div ... class="collapseBarHorizontalWrapper">
		 <div ... class="collapseBarHorizontalCollapse" title="Collapse/expand the top pane">
		   <!-- / -->
  </div>
		 <div ... class="collapseBarHorizontalExpand" title="Collapse/expand the bottom pane">
	<!-- / -->
  </div>
</div>
	   <input id="RadSplitBar1_ClientState" ... />
	 </td>
   </tr>
   <tr id="RAD_SPLITTER_PANE_TR_RadPane2">
	 <td id="RadPane2" valign="top" class="paneHorizontal lastItem" ...>
	   <div id="RAD_SPLITTER_PANE_CONTENT_RadPane2"  ...>
		 ...
	   </div>
	   <input id="RadPane2_ClientState" ... />
	 </td>
   </tr>
   <input id="RadSplitter1_ClientState" ... />
 </table>
</div>				
````

The entire splitter is rendered as a `<div>` element, but the layout is handled by a `<table>` element nested inside that `<div>` element. The `<table>` elementhas the **RadSplitter_Green** class applied. The **RadSplitter_Green** class is applied because the **Skin** property was set to "Green". If the splitter were nested inside the pane of another splitter, the `<table>` would also have the **.nested** or **.nestedHorizontal** class applied (depending on the orientation of the splitter).

Each pane of a splitter is a cell in the main table.The `<td>` elements that represent panes in the example above have the **.paneHorizontal** class applied. In a splitter with a vertical orientation, they would have the **.pane** class applied instead. In addition, the first pane has the **.firstItem** class applied and the last pane has the **.lastItem** class applied.

The split bar is also a cell in the main table. The `<td>` element that represents a split bar in the example has the **.resizeBarHorizontal** class applied.In a splitter with a vertical orientation, it would have the **.resizeBar** class applied instead.

Inside the cell for the split bar is a `<div>` element with the **.collapseBarHorizontalWrapper** class applied. This is the region of the split bar set aside for collapse and expand controls. On a vertical split bar, it would have the **.collapseBarWrapper** class applied instead.

Inside the `<div>` with the **.collapseBarHorizontalWrapper** class are `<div>` elements for the actual collapse and expand buttons. They have the **.collapseBarHorizontalCollapse** and **.collapseBarHorizontalExpand** classes applied. (In a vertical split bar, these would be the **.collapseBarCollapse** and **.collapseBarExpand** classes.)
