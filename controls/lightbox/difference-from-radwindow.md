\* **RadLightBox** provides a two type of animation, **Resize** and **Fade** whereas RadWindow has only a Resize one.

** **RadLightBox** allows you to choose between different animations for the different actions. For instance,	you could choose a **Fade** animation when closing the **LightBox** and set **Resize**	animation when opening it. **RadWindow** does not support this and the animation is the same for each action.

Ideal scenario to use a **LightBox** is when you need to display an image galleries or some simple case, which includes	using of ASP.NET controls. The lightweight design is suitable for such scenarios no matter the number of the displayed items.

On the other hand, preferred usage of **RadWindow** is in cases where controls like RadGrid, RadTreeList and	the like have to be embedded in it.	Another advantage of **RadWindow** control is the ability to move,	while the **RadLightBox** stays static in the middle of the screen.
