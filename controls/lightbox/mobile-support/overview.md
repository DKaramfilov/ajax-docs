# Mobile Support Overview



**Telerik ASP.NET LightBox** comes with built-in **adaptive** behavior. When accessed via a mobile device, the control changes to create a user experience tailored to the device screen size.


To enable the layout change for mobile devices, just set the **RenderMode** property of the **LightBox** to **"Mobile"** andadd the following meta tag to the page's head section:

	
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
          



By setting the **RenderMode** property to "**Auto**" and referencing the [Device Detection Framework](https://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax/device-detection-framework.aspx), you will ensure that the control is 
rendered in an appropriate UI according to the device screen size.

For optimal experience on mobile devices, we suggest that you use Telerik controls together with the [Page Layout Framework](https://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax/responsive-page-layout.aspx), which will 
add responsive capabilities to your layout.
