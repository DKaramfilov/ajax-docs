The **OnClientResizeStart** event of the **RadWindow** fires when the user is about to start resizing the popup. You can cancel the event to prevent the user from resizing the control by calling the `set_canel(true)` method the event arguments object exposes. You can also entirely disable resizing through the	[Behaviors]({%slug window/getting-started/user-interaction-with-the-window%}) property of the **RadWindow**.
