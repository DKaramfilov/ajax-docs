# OnClientCommand


The **OnClientCommand** event fires when a command button from the **RadWindow**'s title bar is clicked or tapped by the user.	The developer can also initiate it by using the [client-side API]({%slug window/client-side-programming/radwindow-object%}) of the control(e.g., the `minimize()`, `maximize()`, `restore()`, `togglePin()` and `reload()` methods). You can cancel this event to prevent the command from executing (**Example 1**).

The event handler receives the following arguments:

1. The [RadWindow]({%slug window/client-side-programming/radwindow-object%}) object that fired the event.

1. An event arguments object that exposes the following methods:


| Name | Parameters | Return Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|get_cancel||boolean|Gets a value indicating whether the event is going to be cancelled.|
|get_commandName||string|This is the name of the command that was initiated.|
|set_cancel|boolean||Sets a value indicating whether the event is going to be cancelled. Pass *true* to cancel the event. The method takes the following arguments: *boolean*â€”a value that indicates whether the event is to be cancelled.|
