# OnClientResize

The **OnClientResize** event of the **RadWindow** fires while the user is resizing the popup.

The event handler receives the following arguments:

1. The [RadWindow]({%slug window/client-side-programming/radwindow-object%}) object that fired the event.

1. An event arguments object that does not expose any methods and properties.

You can use this event to get the current dimensions of the dialog by calling the `getWindowBounds()` method from the [RadWindow client-side API]({%slug window/client-side-programming/radwindow-object%}).
