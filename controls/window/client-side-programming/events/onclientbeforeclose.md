# OnClientBeforeClose

The **OnClientBeforeClose** event of the **RadWindow** control fires when it is about to close. This event can be cancelled (see **Example 1**) to prevent the closing operation (and the [OnClientClose event]({%slug window/client-side-programming/events/onclientclose%}) from firing). The close operation can be initiated from the user by clicking or tapping on the manual close button (X) in the top right-hand side corner of the title bar, or by the developer via calling the `close(optionalArguments)` [client-side method]({%slug window/client-side-programming/radwindow-object%}) of the control.

You can also use this event to [ask the user to confirm whether the dialog should close]({%slug window/how-to/confirm-closing%})(e.g., if there is no data supplied as an argument).

The event handler receives the following arguments:

1. The [RadWindow]({%slug window/client-side-programming/radwindow-object%}) object that fired the event.

1. An event arguments object that exposes the following methods:

|set_cancel|boolean||Sets a value indicating whether the event is going to be cancelled.Pass *true* to cancel the event.The method takes the following arguments: **boolean**â€”a value that indicates whether the event is to be cancelled.|
