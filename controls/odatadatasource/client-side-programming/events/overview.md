## 

RadODataDataSource supports several client-side events that let you customize the processing of data:

* **[OnRequesting]({%slug odatadatasource/client-side-programming/events/onrequesting%})** - occurs when data is requested form the web service;

* **[OnRequestSucceeded]({%slug odatadatasource/client-side-programming/events/onrequestsucceeded%})** - occurs when the request is executed successfully;

* **[OnRequestFail]({%slug odatadatasource/client-side-programming/events/onrequestfail%})** - occurs in case the request fails.
