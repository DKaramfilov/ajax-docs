# OnClientDeleting

## 

The **OnClientDeleting** Client-side event occurs when the item or items are about to be deleted. This event can be cancelled.

The event handler receives two parameters:

1. The instance of the listbox firing the event

2. An event arguments parameter containing the following methods:

* **get_items()** - returns an array of the items selected for deletion

* **get_item()** - returns the item that is about to be deleted.

* **set_cancel()** - lets you cancel the event and prevent items from deleting.

* **get_domEvent()** - returns the DOM event object


The example below shows how to delete an item after the user clicks OK in the confirmation dialog:

````JavaScript
function onClientDeletingHandler(sender, e) {
	if (!confirm("Are you sure?")){   
	 e.set_cancel(true);
}
````
