# Events Overview

## 

**RadListBox** supports a number of client-side events that let you customize the behavior of the listbox:

* [OnClientLoad]({%slug listbox/client-side-programming/events/onclientload%}) client-side event occurs after RadListBox has been fully initialized on the client-side.

* [OnClientDeleting]({%slug listbox/client-side-programming/events/onclientdeleting%}) occurs before the items are deleted. This event can be canceled.

* [OnClientDeleted]({%slug listbox/client-side-programming/events/onclientdeleted%}) occurs after the items are deleted.

* [OnClientDragStart]({%slug listbox/client-side-programming/events/onclientdragstart%}) occurs as the drag operation occurs. This event can be canceled.

* [OnClientDragging]({%slug listbox/client-side-programming/events/onclientdragging%}) occurs while an item is being dragged. This event can be canceled.

* [OnClientDropping]({%slug listbox/client-side-programming/events/onclientdropping%}) occurs before the items are dropped. The event can be canceled.

* [OnClientDropped]({%slug listbox/client-side-programming/events/onclientdropped%}) occurs after the item/items are dropped.

* [OnClientCheckAllChecked]({%slug listbox/client-side-programming/events/onclientcheckallchecked%}) occurs after user clicks on the CheckAll item.

* [OnClientItemsRequesting]({%slug listbox/client-side-programming/events/onclientitemsrequesting%}) occurs before the items are added to the listbox' Items collection.

* [OnClientTransferred]({%slug listbox/client-side-programming/events/onclienttransferred%}) client-side event occurs after the selected item has been transferred to the destination RadListBox.

* [OnClientSelectedIndexChanging]({%slug listbox/client-side-programming/events/onclientselectedindexchanging%}) client-side event occurs when the selected item is about to be changed. This event can be canceled.

* [OnClientContextMenu]({%slug listbox/client-side-programming/events/onclientcontextmenu%}) client-side event occurs when a user right clicks over a listbox item

To subscribe to a client event just set the appropriate property to the name of the javascript function that will handle the event. The function always receives two parameters - a sender (RadListBox firing the event) and event arguments having different methods.

````ASPNET
<telerik:radlistbox id="RadListBox1" allowdelete="true" onclientdeleted="onClientDeletedHandler" runat="server"></telerik:radlistbox>
````

````JavaScript	
function onClientDeletedHandler(sender, e) {
	alert("Successfully deleted: " + e.get_item().get_text());
}	
````

There is a shorter way to handle a client-side event:

````ASPNET
<telerik:radlistbox id="RadListBox2" allowdelete="true" onclientdeleted="(function(sender, e){ alert('Successfully deleted: ' + e.get_item().get_text()); })" runat="server">
</telerik:radlistbox>
````

Similarly, you can set the property in code behind:

````C#
RadListBox1.OnClientDeleted = "onClientDeletedHandler"; 
````
````VB.NET
RadListBox1.OnClientDeleted = "onClientDeletedHandler"
````
