The structure of the **RadListBox** control is as follows:

![RadListBox structure](images/listbox_structure.png)

RadListBox items can contain [checkboxes and/or images]({%slug listbox/functionality/adding-images-and-checkboxes-to-items%}). The navigation buttons are rendered depending on the boolean [AllowReorder]({%slug listbox/functionality/reorder%}), AllowDelete, [AllowTransfer]({%slug listbox/functionality/transfer%}) properties. You can easily can [change their position]({%slug listbox/functionality/button-settings%}) and/or [add custom text]({%slug listbox/accessibility-and-internationalization/localization%}) to them. When RadListBox has no items - you can show a friendly message by using the **EmptyMessage** property.
