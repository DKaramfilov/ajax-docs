# Understanding the Skin CSS File



>caution  **RadUpload** has been replaced by [RadAsyncUpload](https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/asyncupload/examples/overview/defaultcs.aspx), Telerik’s next-generation ASP.NET upload component. If you are considering Telerik’s Upload control for new development, check out the [documentation of RadAsyncUpload ](https://www.telerik.com/help/aspnet-ajax/asyncupload-overview.html) or the [control’s product page](https://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax/asyncupload.aspx). If you are already using **RadUpload** in your projects, you may be interested in reading how easy the transition to RadAsyncUpload is and how you can benefit from it [in this blog post](https://blogs.telerik.com/blogs/12-12-05/the-case-of-telerik-s-new-old-asp.net-ajax-upload-control-radasyncupload). The official support for **RadUpload** has been discontinued in June 2013 (Q2’13), although it is still be available in the suite. We deeply believe that **RadAsyncUpload** can better serve your upload needs and we kindly ask you to transition to it to make sure you take advantage of its support and the new features we constantly add to it.

## 

Styles for RadControls are defined using Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) syntax. Each style consists of a selector that identifies an HTML element to be styled, and property/value pairs that describe each of the style specifics, e.g. color, padding, margins, etc. For example, the ".RadUpload_Default" style defines the text properties for all of the RadUpload controls using the "Default" skin. Additional selectors can override these properties for elements within the controls:

````CSS

.RadUpload_Default * 
{ 
    font-size:11px; 
    line-height:1.24; 
    font-family:arial,verdana,sans-serif;
}
	    
````



See the [CSS Skin File Selectors]({%slug upload/appearance-and-styling/css-skin-file-selectors%}) topic for more information on the specific CSS selectors used for **RadUpload** skins. You can see custom styles applied in the screenshot below:

![Progress Area Overview](images/upload_green_progress_dialog.png)

Each style maps to a "class" attribute in an HTML tag. For example, consider the HTML rendering of the **RadProgressArea** shown above:

````HTML
	    
<div id="RadProgressArea1" class="radupload RadUpload_Green " style="display: none;">
    <div id="RadProgressArea1_Panel">
        <ul class="ruProgress">
            <li class="ruFilePortion">
                <div id="RadProgressArea1_Panel_PrimaryProgressBarOuterDiv" class="ruBar">
                    <div id="RadProgressArea1_Panel_PrimaryProgressBarInnerDiv">
                        <!-- -->
                    </div>
                </div>
                Uploaded <span id="RadProgressArea1_Panel_PrimaryPercent"></span>% (<span id="RadProgressArea1_Panel_PrimaryValue"></span>
                ) Total <span id="RadProgressArea1_Panel_PrimaryTotal"></span></li>
            <li class="ruFileCount">
                <div id="RadProgressArea1_Panel_SecondaryProgressBarOuterDiv" class="ruBar">
                    <div id="RadProgressArea1_Panel_SecondaryProgressBarInnerDiv">
                        <!-- -->
                    </div>
                </div>
                Uploaded files: <span id="RadProgressArea1_Panel_SecondaryPercent"></span>% (<span
                    id="RadProgressArea1_Panel_SecondaryValue"></span>) Total files: <span id="RadProgressArea1_Panel_SecondaryTotal">
                    </span></li>
            <li class="ruCurrentFile">Uploading file: <span id="RadProgressArea1_Panel_CurrentOperation">
            </span></li>
            <li class="ruTimeSpeed">Elapsed time: <span id="RadProgressArea1_Panel_TimeElapsed">
            </span>&nbsp; Estimated time: <span id="RadProgressArea1_Panel_TimeEstimated"></span>
                &nbsp; Speed: <span id="RadProgressArea1_Panel_Speed"></span></li>
            <li class="ruActions">
                <input name="RadProgressArea1$Panel$CancelButton" type="button" id="RadProgressArea1_Panel_CancelButton"
                    value="Cancel" class="ruButton ruCancel" />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <input id="RadProgressArea1_ClientState" name="RadProgressArea1_ClientState" type="hidden" />
</div>
````



The dialog is rendered as a `<div>` element with the **radupload** and **RadUpload_Green** classes applied. The **radupload** class is always applied, and supplies the basic presentation of all **RadUpload** and **RadProgressArea** controls, regardless of the skin. The **RadUpload_Green** class is applied because the **Skin** property was set to "Green". If no skin had been supplied, the `<div>` would only have the **radupload** class applied.

Inside the main `<div>` element is an unordered list (`<ul>` element) which is responsible for laying out the rows of the dialog. This `<ul>` element has the **ruProgress** class applied.

Each row is an `<li>` element, and has a class applied that identifies the row:

* The row with the **Total Progress Bar** and **Total Progress Indicators** has the **ruFilePortion** class applied.

* The row with the **Files Count Bar** and **Files Count Indicators** has the **ruFileCount** class applied.

* The row with the **Current File Name** has the **ruCurrentFile** class applied.

* The row with **Time and Speed Indicators** has the **ruTimeSpeed** class applied.

* The row with the **Cancel button** has the **ruActions** class applied.

Inside the rows, different types of elements get additional classes applied. For example, progress bars are `<div>` elements with the **ruBar** class applied, while the cancel button is an `<input>` element with the **ruButton** and **ruCancel** classes applied.

Selectors in the CSS file identifies styles based on this rendering. Thus, a selector such as **.RadUpload_Green .ruBar** would apply to both progress bars, while a selector such as **.RadUpload_Green .ruFilePortion .ruBar** would apply only to the **Total Progress Bar** but not the **Files Count Bar**.
