# OnClientClearing



>caution  **RadUpload** has been replaced by [RadAsyncUpload](https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/asyncupload/examples/overview/defaultcs.aspx), Telerik’s next-generation ASP.NET upload component. If you are considering Telerik’s Upload control for new development, check out the [documentation of RadAsyncUpload ](https://www.telerik.com/help/aspnet-ajax/asyncupload-overview.html) or the [control’s product page](https://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax/asyncupload.aspx). If you are already using **RadUpload** in your projects, you may be interested in reading how easy the transition to RadAsyncUpload is and how you can benefit from it [in this blog post](https://blogs.telerik.com/blogs/12-12-05/the-case-of-telerik-s-new-old-asp.net-ajax-upload-control-radasyncupload). The official support for **RadUpload** has been discontinued in June 2013 (Q2’13), although it is still be available in the suite. We deeply believe that **RadAsyncUpload** can better serve your upload needs and we kindly ask you to transition to it to make sure you take advantage of its support and the new features we constantly add to it.

## 

The **OnClientClearing** client-side event occurs when the value of a file input is about to be cleared.

The event handler receives two parameters:

1. The instance of the **RadUpload** control firing the event.

1. An eventArgs parameter containing the following methods:

	* **set_cancel** lets you prevent the file input from being cleared.

	* **get_cancel** returns whether the clearing of the file input has been cancelled.

	* **get_fileInputField** returns the file input field that is about to be cleared.

	* **get_row** returns the row that is about to be cleared (`<LI>` element)

	* **get_rowIndex** returns the index of the row

The following example uses the **OnClientClearing** event to display a confirmation dialog:

````ASPNET
<telerik:radupload runat="server" id="RadUpload1" onclientclearing="confirmClear" />
<script type="text/javascript">
    function confirmClear(radUpload, eventArgs) {
        //Check if the input field to be cleared has a file selected    
        if (eventArgs.get_fileInputField().value.length > 0) {
            eventArgs.set_cancel(!confirm("Are you sure you want to clear this field?"));
        }
    }
</script>
````
