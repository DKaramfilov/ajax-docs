# RadUpload Context



>caution  **RadUpload** has been replaced by [RadAsyncUpload](https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/asyncupload/examples/overview/defaultcs.aspx), Telerik’s next-generation ASP.NET upload component. If you are considering Telerik’s Upload control for new development, check out the [documentation of RadAsyncUpload ](https://www.telerik.com/help/aspnet-ajax/asyncupload-overview.html) or the [control’s product page](https://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax/asyncupload.aspx). If you are already using **RadUpload** in your projects, you may be interested in reading how easy the transition to RadAsyncUpload is and how you can benefit from it [in this blog post](https://blogs.telerik.com/blogs/12-12-05/the-case-of-telerik-s-new-old-asp.net-ajax-upload-control-radasyncupload). The official support for **RadUpload** has been discontinued in June 2013 (Q2’13), although it is still be available in the suite. We deeply believe that **RadAsyncUpload** can better serve your upload needs and we kindly ask you to transition to it to make sure you take advantage of its support and the new features we constantly add to it.

## 

You can access all uploaded files within the current request using the **RadUploadContext** object. This is especially useful when you are [using standard file input controls]({%slug upload/uploading-files/using-standard-file-input-controls%}). You can obtain an instance of the upload context object using the **static**(C#) or **shared** (VB) property **Current**:





````C#
	     
using Telerik.Web.UI...
protected void Button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{  
    RadUploadContext uploadContext = RadUploadContext.Current;  
    ...
}
				
````
````VB.NET
	     
Imports Telerik.Web.UI
...
Protected Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    Dim uploadContext As RadUploadContext = RadUploadContext.Current
End Sub
	
````


The **RadUploadContext** object has a single property: **UploadedFiles**. **UploadedFiles** is a collection of all files that have been uploaded within the current request, including those selected with **RadUpload** controls and those selected with regular **`<input type=file>`** elements.

Each file in the collection is of type **UploadedFile**. The following table lists the members of the **UploadedFile** class:
