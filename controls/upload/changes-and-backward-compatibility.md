# Changes and Backward Compatibility



>caution  **RadUpload** has been replaced by[RadAsyncUpload](https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/asyncupload/examples/overview/defaultcs.aspx), Telerik’s next-generation ASP.NET upload component. If you are considering Telerik’s Upload control for new development, check out the[ documentation of RadAsyncUpload ](https://www.telerik.com/help/aspnet-ajax/asyncupload-overview.html)or the[control’s product page](https://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax/asyncupload.aspx). If you are already using **RadUpload** in your projects, you may be interested in reading how easy the transition to RadAsyncUpload is and how you can benefit from it[in this blog post](https://blogs.telerik.com/blogs/12-12-05/the-case-of-telerik-s-new-old-asp.net-ajax-upload-control-radasyncupload). The official support for **RadUpload** has been discontinued in June 2013 (Q2’13), although it is still be available in the suite. We deeply believe that **RadAsyncUpload** can better serve your upload needs and we kindly ask you to transition to it to make sure you take advantage of its support and the new features we constantly add to it.

## Changes in Q3 SP1 2008 version (2008.3.1125)

* The default URL of RadUploadProgressHandler.ashx was page-relative, which needed additional efforts for the handler to be excluded from URL rewriters. It is now application-relative

* RadProgressManager’s UniquePageIdentifier property is now obsolete. It is generated automatically

## Changes in Q2 2008 version (2008.2.723)

* [ New Localization for RadProgressArea using the Localization property or GlobalResource Files ]({%slug progressarea/localization/localizing-radprogressarea%})

RadProgressArea’s **Localization** property is **not a dictionary** anymore. Instead, the object contains strongly named properties

*old way*: RadProgressArea1.Localization["Total"] = "Total";* new way *: RadProgressArea1.Localization.Total = "Total";

* **RadProgressContext** now offers strongly named properties:

context["CurrentOperationText"] = "Doing step " + i.ToString();

is the same as

context.CurrentOperationText = "Doing step " + i.ToString();

* The **Mac** skins has been removed from the Telerik.Web.UI assembly. More information on Q2 Skinning is available [here](https://blogs.telerik.com/ZhivkoDimitrov/Posts/08-06-27/Q2_Asp_Net_skinning.aspx?ReturnURL=%2fZhivkoDimitrov%2fPosts.aspx).

* Memory optimization now relies on the default .NET Framework 2.0+ engine. **EnableMemoryOptimization** property is now **obsolete**.

* **Telerik.RadUpload.TempFolder** application setting is now **obsolete**, as the files are handled by the standard .NET Framework engine

* Client-side localization does not honor the **Telerik.Web.UI.RadUploadUtils.Localization** object anymore. Instead, the client-side **set_localization** property is used.
