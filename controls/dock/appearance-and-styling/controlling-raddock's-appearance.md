# Controlling RadDock's Appearance



There are a number of ways you can customize the look & feel of your **RadDock** and **RadDockZone** controls:

## RadDockZone

* To change the overall look and feel of the **RadDockZone** control, set its [Skin]({%slug dock/appearance-and-styling/skins%}) property.

* To change [the layout of docked controls]({%slug dock/getting-started/dock-zone-orientation%}) within the **RadDockZone** control, use the **Orientation** property.

* To cause the **RadDockZone** to be [highlighted]({%slug dock/structure/dock-zones/highlighting%}) when the user is dragging a **RadDock** control over it that can be docked, use the **HighlightedCssClass** property.

## RadDock

* To change the overall look and feel of the **RadDock** control, set its [Skin]({%slug dock/appearance-and-styling/skins%}) property.

* To change the visual cues for where the user can start a [drag operation]({%slug dock/getting-started/drag-and-drop%}), use the **DockHandle** property.

* To [specify the content]({%slug dock/how-to/adding-content-to-raddock%}) that appears inside the **RadDock** control, use the **ContentTemplate**, the **ContentContainer** property, or the **Text** property.

* To customize the appearance and behavior of the title bar, use a [title bar template]({%slug dock/structure/dock/title-bar-template%}).

* To change the [commands]({%slug dock/commands/overview%}) that appear in the **RadDock** title bar, use the **DefaultCommands** property or the **Commands** property collection.

* To change [the appearance of the command icons]({%slug dock/commands/styling-custom-commands%}) on the title bar, use the **CssClass** property of the command object.

* A range of **Text** properties let you [change the tooltips]({%slug dock/commands/specifying-command-tooltips%}) that appear when the user hovers the mouse over the command icons in the title bar.
