# Dock Collection Editor


 

There are two ways to add **RadDock** controls to a **RadDockZone** control at design time. You can drag a **RadDock** control directly from the toolbox onto the surface of the **RadDockZone** control or you can add the **RadDock** controls using the **RadDock Collection Editor**. The **RadDock Collection Editor** is also useful for locating **RadDock** controls and setting their properties when the **RadDockZone** control has many child **RadDock** controls.

To display the **RadDock Collection Editor**, click on the ellipsis button for the **Docks** property of the **RadDockZone** control.

* Click the **Add** button to append a new **RadDock** control to the collection.

* Use the up and down arrow buttons to rearrange the **RadDock** controls in the collection. This order determines the order in which **RadDock** controls are docked inside the **RadDockZone**.

* Select a **RadDock** control and click the **Remove** button to delete it from the list.

* Select individual **RadDock** controls to change their properties.

Some important properties of the **RadDock** controls in the **Docks** collection are as follows:

* **DockHandle**, **DockMode**, and **ForbiddenZones**: These properties let you specify the desired [drag-and-drop behavior]({%slug dock/getting-started/drag-and-drop%}).

* **DefaultCommands** or **Commands** lets you add [commands]({%slug dock/commands/overview%}) to the **RadDock** title bar.

* **Text** lets you assign simple text to the **RadDock** control's [content area]({%slug dock/how-to/adding-content-to-raddock%}).

* **CloseText**, **CollapseText**, **ExpandText**, **PinText**, and **UnpinText** let you [customize the tooltips for built-in commands]({%slug dock/commands/specifying-command-tooltips%}).

* **Skin** lets you set the [skin]({%slug dock/appearance-and-styling/skins%}) to override the default inherited from the parent **RadDockZone**.

* **UniqueName** givesthe **RadDock** control a unique name that the **RadDockLayout** component uses for maintaining position information. If this property is not set, **RadDockLayout** uses the **ID** property. It is important to set this property at runtime if the **RadDock** control is embedded in a repeating control, so that each instance has a unique name.

* **Tag** is a string you can use to store your own application-specific information with the **RadDock** control.
