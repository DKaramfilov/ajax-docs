# NodeDataBound


The **NodeDataBound** event occurs for each new node that is added to the **Nodes** collection of the Navigation when it is bound.This event only occurs if the nodes are loaded from a data source (the **DataSource** or **DataSourceID** property is set).

For each node that is added from a data source, the following events occur:

1. A new node is created and added to the Nodes collection.

1. The **ItemDataBound** event occurs.

The **NodeDataBound** event handler receives two arguments:

1. The **Navigation** that is loading the nodes. This argument is of type object, but can be cast to the **RadNavigation** type.

1. An EventArgs object. This object has an **Node** property, which provides access to the node that was just bound. This item, in turn, has a **DataItem** property,which lets you access the item in the data source to which the **NavigationNode** is being bound.

Use the **NodeDataBound** event handler to make changes to items as they are bound to the data. For example, you can set custom attributes based on other fields in the DataItem:
