# OnClientNodeAnimationEnd



## 

The **OnClientNodeAnimationEnd** event fires when the node is expanded / collapsed and after the animation has finished.

The event handler has two parameters:

1. The **TreeView** instance that fired the event.

1. Event arguments with functions:

* **get_node()** retrieves a reference to the node being toggled.

* **get_expanding()** returns true if the node is expanded and false if it collapsed.
