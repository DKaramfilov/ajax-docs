# Single Expand Path



## 

When set to **True** the **SingleExpandPath** property of **RadTreeView** automatically collapses Nodes that are not on the path of the currently expanded Node. Use the **SingleExpandPath** property when you need to conserve screen space and make navigating Nodes easier.
