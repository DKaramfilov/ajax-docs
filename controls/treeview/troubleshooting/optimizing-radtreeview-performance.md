# Optimizing RadTreeView Performance



## 

The performance of **RadTreeView for ASP.NET AJAX** depends mainly on the number of Nodes that are loaded in the control at any moment. The overall output of the TreeView increases with the number of Nodes, which impacts the control’s performance.

**Load on demand**

The load on demand mechanism of **RadTreeView** comes of a great help in this situation. It enables the control to load Nodes only when they are required (about to be rendered), that is when a Node is expanded and its children Nodes are shown.

**RadTreeView** supports three different Load on Demand modes:

• Server side PostBack

• Server side Callback

• Web Service

Each of the Load on Demand modes has its pros and cons. Below are a visual comparison table of each of the three Load on Demand modes according to three criterions - performance, templates support, ease of implementation and a brief description of each mode:


|  | Performance | Templates Support | Ease of Implementation |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|Server Side PostBack| * | ***** | ***** |
|Server Side Callback| ** | *** | **** |
|Web Service| ***** | * | *** |



**Server Side PostBack**

**Performance**

The Server Side PostBack mode has worst performance without any doubts. The page is posted back and as a result all controls are rendered and updated. A possible workaround is to wrap the **RadTreeView** control inside **RadAjaxPanel** or **UpdatePanel**. Then only the **RadTreeView** control will be updated. Still performance will be worse than other load on demand modes because the whole **RadTreeView** control will be rendered and updated.

**Templates**

Full support for templates with no limitations.

**Implementation**

As with the Server Side Callback mode the user should subscribe to the **NodeExpand** event and add child nodes to the currently expanded Node. A side effect from the full postback is that the developer can update other controls in the page (provided **RadTreeView** is not wrapped inside **RadAjaxPanel**/**UpdatePanel**).

**Server Side Callback**

**Performance**

Server Side Callback mode comes second. Using ASP.NET 2.0 Callbacks involves sending the **ViewState** of the page back to the server. The page life cycle is executed as well. The good thing is that only a small portion of HTML is returned - only the nodes added during the **NodeExpand** event.

**Templates**

Server Side Callback mode supports templates with one limitation. It does not support any controls with client-side behavior (e.g. other RadControls for ASP.NET AJAX). You can use anything else though - static HTML, text boxes, buttons etc.

**Implementation**

It is a lot easier to subscribe to an event and create **RadTreeNode** objects than implement a **Web Service**. A good thing to know when using Server Side Callback mode is that only the expanded **RadTreeNode** will be updated after the load on demand request finishes. If you update any other control in the page the changes will not be applied (rendered). Additionally the **IsCallback** property of the page is **true** during server side callbacks. So binding of other controls on the page during such requests can be skipped if necessary.

**Web Service**

**Performance**

The Web Service load on demand mode undisputedly delivers the best performance. It does not execute the page lifecycle, does not send the **ViewState** to the server and outputs tidy JSON which saves precious traffic.

**Templates**

The Web Service load on demand mode completely disregards the template set for **RadTreeView**, or otherwise put templates do not work in this case. The reason is simple. Since only JSON is sent back and forth the actual template contents (controls and HTML that is) are lost. **RadTreeView** utilizes its client-side rendering abilities to convert the JSON returned from the web service into HTML representation of tree nodes. A possible workaround is to use ASP.NET AJAX 4.0 templates (check [here](https://blogs.telerik.com/AtanasKorchev/Posts/08-07-23/RadControls_and_ASP_NET_Ajax_4_0_Preview.aspx?ReturnURL=/AtanasKorchev/Posts.aspx) for more information, a sample project and running demo).

**Implementation**

Implementing a Web Service method is a bit more complicated than subscribing to a server-side event (**NodeExpand**) for example, but the resulting performance boost is worth the extra work.


The Web Service load on demand mode in its basic implementation delivers the best performance compared to the other two modes: Server Side PostBack and Server Side Callback. But this is not all - the mode can further be optimized to achieve even better performance.

**Web Service load on demand optimization tips**

**Use a custom class instead of RadTreeNodeData**

The serialized output of the **WebService** can be minimized by using a custom class instead of the default **RadTreeNodeData**. This class can represent the minimum amount of data that is required for the Nodes of the **RadTreeView**. Below is a sample implementation of a 'minimized' **NodeData** class and a sample use case:



````C#
[WebMethod]
public IEnumerable GetNodes(RadTreeNodeData node, IDictionary context)
{
    int numberOfNodes = 1000;
    List<NodeData> nodes = new List<NodeData>();
    for (int i = 0; i < numberOfNodes; i++)
    {
        NodeData nodeData = new NodeData();
        nodeData.Text = "Node " + i;
        nodes.Add(nodeData);
    }
    return nodes;
}
class NodeData
{
    private string text;
    public string Text
    {
        get { return text; }
        set { text = value; }
    }
} 	
````
````VB.NET
<WebMethod()> _
Public Function GetNodes(ByVal node As RadTreeNodeData, ByVal context As IDictionary) As IEnumerable
    Dim numberOfNodes As Integer = 1000
    Dim nodes As List(Of NodeData) = New List(Of NodeData)()
    For i As Integer = 0 To numberOfNodes - 1
        Dim nodeData As New NodeData()
        nodeData.Text = "Node " & i
        nodes.Add(nodeData)
    Next i
    Return nodes
End Function

Friend Class NodeData
    Private text_Renamed As String
    Public Property Text() As String
        Get
            Return text_Renamed
        End Get
        Set(ByVal value As String)
            text_Renamed = value
        End Set
    End Property
End Class
````


**Do not persist nodes loaded on demand**

Setting the **PersistLoadOnDemandNodes** property to **false** will also improve performance. However the nodes loaded on demand will not be able to fire server-side events (**NodeClick**, **NodeDrop** etc). There are workarounds still - using **RadAjaxManager** to simulate the postbacks (check [here](https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet/prometheus/TreeView/Examples/Programming/Performance/DefaultCS.aspx) for a running demo of this approach).



These were the optimization tips for the load on demand process of **RadTreeView**. There are still a few more things that can improve the performance.

**Other optimization tips**

**Make sure ASP.NET Ajax scripts are not in debug mode**

Either set **<compilation debug="false">** in your web.config or set the **ScriptMode** property of the **ScriptManager** to **"Release"**. This is a general performance tip when working with RadControls for ASP.NET AJAX. Always deploy your web sites with **<compilation debug="false">**.

**Line images affect performance**

By using a skin with no line images (e.g. "Vista") or setting the **ShowLineImages** property to **false** you can improve the loading time even more.
