## Causes and Solutions

Telerik **RadTreeView** cannot find its JavaScript code. The necessary code is fetched either from the **WebResource.axd** file or from files located in the project's folder, depending on the control's settings.

## Case 1: EnableEmbeddedScripts property of Telerik RadTreeView is set to false:

* The control's scripts are not referenced - first, copy the needed script files from the installation directory of RadControls for ASP.NET AJAX in the project's directory; then reference them from the **ScriptManager** like this:

````ASPNET
<asp:ScriptManager ID="ScriptManager1" runat="server">
    <Scripts>
        <asp:ScriptReference Path="~/Scripts/Common/Core.js" />
        <asp:ScriptReference Path="~/Scripts/Common/Animation/AnimationScripts.js" />
        <asp:ScriptReference Path="~/Scripts/Common/Navigation/NavigationScripts.js" />
        <asp:ScriptReference Path="~/Scripts/TreeView/RadTreeViewScripts.js" />
    </Scripts>
</asp:ScriptManager>
````



* The control's scripts are referenced but the error still shows which means the **RadTreeViewScripts.js** file is not physically in the location specified by the **Path** property or the file is inaccessible.To make sure that this is really the case, you can copy the path to the **RadTreeViewScripts.js** file for example in the browser and see if you have access to this file. If you cannot retrieve this file you will see the following error message:

The solution is to make sure that the file is intact, and it is in the location specified by the **Path** property of the **ScriptManager**. If the file is accessible you will be able to view it or download it:

## Case 2: EnableEmbeddedScripts property of Telerik RadTreeView is set to true (Default case)

In this case **RadTreeView** will search for its JavaScript code embedded in the **WebResource.axd** and **ScriptResource.axd** as part of the **DLL** of the control's suite.
