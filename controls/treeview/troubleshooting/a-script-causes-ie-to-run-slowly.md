# A Script Causes IE to Run Slowly



## 

**The problem**

You receive an error message like "Stop running the script" or "A script is causing IE to run slowly" when you expand a node which loads its child nodes on demand. A timeout error could occur as well.



**The resolution**

You can use one of the solutions below:

* Disable debugging in your **web.config** file. Note that this is the **recommended** setting for a **production environment**.

````XML
<compilation debug="false">
````


Or, use the second approach described below.


* Set the **ScriptMode** property of  **ScriptManager** / **RadScriiptManager** to "**Release**":

````ASPNET
<asp:ScriptManager ID="ScriptManager1"     
                   runat="server"     
                   ScriptMode="release">
</asp:ScriptManager>
````



````ASPNET
<telerik:RadScriptManager ID="RadScriptManager1"     
                          ScriptMode="Release"    
                          runat="server">
</telerik:RadScriptManager>
````
