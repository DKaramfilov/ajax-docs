# Custom Dictionaries



## 

An important feature of the **RadSpell** is its ability to create custom dictionaries for every language. If you set the **AllowAddCustom** property to **true** an "Add to custom" button will appear in the **RadSpell** dialog. If an unknown word is found the user can add it to the custom dictionary, which will automatically be created.

Custom dictionaries are text files located in the folder specified in the **DictionaryPath** property ("~**/App_Data/RadSpell/**" by default). Their names are composed of the language name + suffix, specified in the **CustomDictionarySuffix** property. The default value of the CustomDictionarySuffix property is "-custom", so with the default values, the custom dictionary name will be "*en-US-custom.txt"*.
