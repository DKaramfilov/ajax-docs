# Dictionary Configurator

The Dictionary Configurator tool is useful for creating new dictionary files and editing existing dictionaries. The Dictionary Configurator tool is attached as a web project in the following code-library project: [Dictionary Configuration](https://www.telerik.com/support/code-library/dictionary-configuration).

Using the **Dictionary Configurator** tool you can:

1. **Import a new dictionary**: Import files are text files, having one word per line with no leading or trailing whitespace.Old TDF files are suitable too.

1. **Edit dictionaries**: You can add and delete words to/from a selected custom dictionary file. You can also search for words or for the occurrence of a given string in dictionary files.

	Wordlists should follow the same import format as custom dictionaries, e.g. the imported text files, should have one word per line with no leading or trailing whitespaces.
