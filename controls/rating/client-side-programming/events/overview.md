# Events Overview

The **RadRating** exposes several client-side events that allow easy and flexible use of the control:

1. [OnClientLoad]({%slug rating/client-side-programming/events/onclientload%}) - fires when the [RadRating client-side object]({%slug rating/client-side-programming/overview%}) is initialized.

1. [OnClientRating]({%slug rating/client-side-programming/events/onclientrating%}) - fires when you click a rating item. You can use it to prevent the setting of a new value to the control.

1. [OnClientRated]({%slug rating/client-side-programming/events/onclientrated%}) - fires after you click a rating item.
