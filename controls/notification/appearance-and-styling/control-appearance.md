# Control Appearance


 

There are a number of ways you can customize the look & feel of your notifications:

* To change the overall look and feel of the notification, set the [Skin]({%slug notification/appearance-and-styling/skins%}) property.

* To change the content within the notification, set the **Text** property, the **Title** property or add controls in its ContentTemplate.

* To change the way the notification initially becomes visible, use the [Animation]({%slug notification/appearance-and-styling/animation%}) property.

* To change the look of an individual aspect of the notification, use its **CssClass** property and set up CSS styles as needed.
