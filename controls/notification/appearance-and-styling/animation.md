# Animation





How the notification becomes visible on the screen can be controlled with the **Animation** property. Possible values are:

* None

* Resize

* Fade

* Slide

* FlyIn

You can define how long the animation will take by setting the **AnimationDuration** property. Its value is set in milliseconds. This property takes effect only if the **Animation** property is set to a value, different than **None** (which is the default). The default value of the **AnimationDuration** property itself is 500 milliseconds.

For a live demonstration showing notifications with all possible combinations of values see the [Notification Configurator Live Demo](https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/notification/examples/configurator/defaultcs.aspx).
