# Client-side Programming Overview



The **RadNotification** object provides a client-side API that lets you interact with the control in client-side code. In addition to a full set of [client-side events]({%slug notification/client-side-programming/events/overview%}), the client-side object model lets you manipulate notifications while avoiding unnecessary post-backs.

## Getting the RadNotification client-side object

The **RadNotification** creates a client-side object with the ClientID of the control. You can obtain the reference to this object by using the following JavaScript code:

````JavaScript
var radNotification1 = $find("<%= RadNotification1.ClientID %>");
````



## Cancelling an Action

Some client-side events occur immediately before **RadNotification** performs some action. You can use these events to cancel the impending action by using the cancel property of the eventArgs passed to the handler:

````JavaScript
function OnClientShowing(sender, eventArgs)
{
    eventArgs.set_cancel(true);
}
````
