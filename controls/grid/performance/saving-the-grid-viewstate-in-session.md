# Saving the grid ViewState in Session



## 

There are cases in which you may want to reduce the grid ViewState though you have enabled multiple server/client side features of the control (thus bypassing the EnableViewState = false choice with [its limitations]({%slug grid/performance/optimizing-viewstate-usage%})). In such situation to work properly with the **NeedDataSource** advanced data-binding or population through data source control, Telerik RadGrid's ViewState has to be turned on.

Still, a possible solution for ViewState reduction is to relocate it in a Session variable. The code below illustrates how to apply this technique under ASP.NET 3.x or 4.x:**ASP.NET 3.x/4.x:**



````C#
PageStatePersister _pers;
protected override PageStatePersister PageStatePersister
{
    get
    {
        if (_pers == null)
        {
            _pers = new SessionPageStatePersister(this);
        }
        return _pers;
    }
}
````
````VB	
Dim _pers As PageStatePersister
Protected Overrides ReadOnly Property PageStatePersister As PageStatePersister
    Get
        If _pers Is Nothing Then
            _pers = New SessionPageStatePersister(Me)
        End If
        Return _pers
    End Get
End Property
````
