# Customizing the Group Panel



## GroupPanel Customization

If grouping is enabled, Telerik RadGrid will allow grouping by column(s). You need to drag-and-drop the headers of one or more columns on the group panel to define the grouping.

You can modify panel's appearance using **PanelStyle** and **PanelItemsStyle** properties.The **PanelStyle** property customizes the panel itself, and the **PanelItemStyle** property customizes the items in this panel.
