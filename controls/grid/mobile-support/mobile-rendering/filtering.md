# Filtering



## 

When the active **RenderMode** of the **RadGrid** is set to **Mobile**, its filtering layout and user interaction will differ from that of its standard interface. This is done to optimize the user convenience when the page is accessed via a mobile or tablet device.

## Default Filtering

In the **Mobile** filtering version of RadGrid, the regular auto-generated textboxes are replaced with an appropriate filter form,which can be used to type in the desired filtering criteria. To enable this functionality, you have to set the **AllowFilteringByColumn** property of the corresponding GridTableView to **True**.

Once the filter item is visible, you can use the generated buttons to move into filter form.

The filter form can be thereby opened and the user may enter their custom filtering dependencies.

## Context Filter Menu

There is also an alternative way to open the filter form. When the **EnableHeaderContextMenu** property is enabled, you will also need to set the **EnableHeaderContextFilterMenu** to **True** in order for the filtering to appear in the context menu options.
