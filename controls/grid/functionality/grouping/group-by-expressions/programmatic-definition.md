# Programmatic Definition



## 

Each **GridTableView** object has a **GroupByExpressions** property. **GroupByExpressions** is a collection of group expressions (**GridGroupByExpression** objects).

Each **GridGroupByExpression** object in this collection defines a set of groups in the corresponding table. At the top of each group of items is a **GridGroupHeaderItem**, which can display information about the common properties of the group items or aggregate values that summarize the items in the group.

You can set the **GroupByExpressions** property in the code-behind to specify the grouping for the tables in the grid. When setting **GroupByExpressions** at runtime.

1. For each set of groups, generate a new instance of **GridGroupByExpression**.
2. For each **GridGroupByExpression** object, generate instances of **GridGroupByField** for each field that is used to group data and for each field that provides a value displayed in the group headers.
3. Set the properties of the **GridGroupByField** objects to identify the fields they represent and the display properties for those fields. You can set any of the following properties:
	* **FieldName** specifies the name of a field in the data source (meaningful for items both from the **SelectFields** and **GroupByFields** collections)
	* **FieldAlias** specifies an alias for representing the field's name (meaningful for items from the **SelectFields** collection only)
	* **Aggregate** specifies a **GridAggregateFunction** value. This property is only for fields displayed in the group header (meaningful for items from the **SelectFields** collection only)
	* **HeaderText** specifies the name to use for the field when it appears in the group header and in the group panel (meaningful for items from the **SelectFields** collection only)
	* **HeaderValueSeparator** specifies a string that appears in the group header between the header text and the value (or aggregated value) - meaningful for items from the **SelectFields** collection only
	* **FormatString** specifies a format string for formatting field values when they appear in the group header (meaningful for items from the **SelectFields** collection only)
	* **SortOrder** specifies how group values are sorted. Its value can be "Ascending" or "Descending" (meaningful for items from the **GroupByFields** collection only)
4. Add the **GridGroupByField** objects that represent fields in the group header to the **SelectFields** collection. Add **GridGroupByField** objects that represent how the data is grouped to the **GroupbyFields** collection.
5. Add the **GridGroupByExpression** object to the **GroupByExpressions** collection of the **MasterTableView** or detail **GridTableView**.

>caution Note that a **FieldAlias** for the **GroupByFields** should not be set as it can cause unexpected behavior. An alias can only be set for the **SelectFields** .
