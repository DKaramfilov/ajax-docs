# Group Load Modes



## 

You can specify whether a table view in the grid handles grouping on the client or on the server:

* **Server-side grouping**: To enable grouping on the server, set the **GroupLoadMode** property of a table view to "Server". (this is the default behavior). When grouping is handled on the server, the grid performs a postback to the server every time a group is expanded.

````ASP.NET
<MasterTableView GroupLoadMode="Server" />
````



* **Client-side grouping**: To enable grouping on the client, set the **GroupLoadMode** property of a table view to "Client" and the **ClientSettings.AllowGroupExpandCollapse** property to **True**. When grouping is handled on the client, groups are expanded client-side, without a postback. This means that the data for all groups, whether they are expanded or not, must be loaded on the client.

````ASP.NET
<MasterTableView GroupLoadMode="Client" />
<ClientSettings AllowGroupExpandCollapse="True" />
````



>caution Note that with client load mode of the groups the **GroupsDefaultExpanded="false"** setting will work only for the root items. Once you expand a root group, its child groups will get expanded too.

For a live example that demonstrates the **GroupLoadMode** property, see [Client group load](https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/Grid/Examples/GroupBy/GroupLoadModeClient/DefaultCS.aspx).
