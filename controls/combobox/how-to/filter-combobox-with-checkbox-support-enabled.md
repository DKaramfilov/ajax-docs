# Filter ComboBox with CheckBox support enabled



## 

The combo box provides a nice built-in support for **CheckBoxes** which can be used in many real-case scenarios leveraging multiple selection:

The control also provides the **Filtering** capability which adds convenient behavior allowing users to find quickly what they are looking for:

Due to internal specifics of these 2 logics, combo box **Filtering** and **MarkFirstMatch** are incompatible with **CheckBoxes** layout by default. Since it can be desired and meaningful to have these both features work together, we created a sample addressing this case. 

The following code library example demonstrates how the combo box can be filtered when **CheckBox** support is enabled by embedding a TextBox in the combo box' Header Template:
