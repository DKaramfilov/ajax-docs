# ItemDataBound



## 

The **ItemDataBound** event occurs for each new item that is added to the **Items** collection of the combobox when it is bound. This event only occurs if the items are loaded from a data source (the **DataSource** or **DataSourceID** property is set).

For each item that is added from a data source, the following events occur:

1. A new item is created and added to the Items collection.

2. The [ItemCreated]({%slug combobox/server-side-programming/itemcreated%}) event occurs.

3. The **Text** and **Value** properties of the item are set, based on the data.

4. The **ItemDataBound** event occurs.

The **ItemDataBound** event handler receives two arguments:

1. The **RadComboBox** that is loading items. This argument is of type object, but can be cast to the **RadComboBox** type.

2. An EventArgs object. This object has an **Item** property, which provides access to the item that was just bound. This item, in turn, has a **DataItem** property, which lets you access the item in the data source to which the **RadComboBoxItem** is being bound.

Use the **ItemDataBound** event handler to make changes to items as they are bound to the data. For example, you can set custom attributes based on other fields in the DataItem:



````C#
	     
protected void RadComboBox1_ItemDataBound(object o, RadComboBoxItemEventArgs e)
{ 
    DataRowView dataSourceRow = (DataRowView) e.Item.DataItem;  
    //set custom attributes from the datasource:  
    e.Item.Attributes["customAttribute1"] = dataSourceRow["CustomAttribute1"].ToString(); 
    e.Item.Attributes["customAttribute2"] = dataSourceRow["CustomAttribute2"].ToString();
}
				
````
````VB.NET
	
Protected Sub RadComboBox1_ItemDataBound(ByVal o As Object, ByVal e As RadComboBoxItemEventArgs) Handles RadComboBox1.ItemDataBound

    Dim dataSourceRow As DataRowView = CType(e.Item.DataItem, DataRowView)
    'set custom attributes from the datasource:  
    e.Item.Attributes("customAttribute1") = dataSourceRow("CustomAttribute1").ToString()
    e.Item.Attributes("customAttribute1") = dataSourceRow("CustomAttribute2").ToString()

End Sub
