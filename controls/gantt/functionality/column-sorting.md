# Column Sorting



**RadGantt** offers sorting capabilities that allows the users to conveniently order the tasks in the tree list in the desired direction.The feature is enable by default and the control will handle the sorting operations automatically. You could disable the sorting generally by setting **AllowSorting** property to **false** of the control or disable the sorting of a particular column by setting the same property oneach column which should not have this feature enabled.

## 

There are three sort modes:

* **Ascending** - orders the items in ascending order.

* **Descending** - orders the items in descending order.

* **None** - the items are ordered in the way they came from the datasource ("Natural" sort).
