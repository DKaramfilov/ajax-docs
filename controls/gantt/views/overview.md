# Views Overview



**RadGantt** displays tasks in four basic views: **Day view, Week view, Month view and Year view**. The **SelectedView** property specifies which of these views the gantt control uses when it first appears (loads). By default, the user can move between **Day, Week and Month** views using the view tabs. You can remove specific view tab by setting the **UserSelectable** property of the view to **false**. Setting the same property to **true** for **YearView** will display a view tab for **Year** along with the default three.


## Common Settings for All Views

In this section you could find all common properties that are shared among all views.
