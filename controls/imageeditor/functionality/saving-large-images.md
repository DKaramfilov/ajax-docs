# Saving Large Images

This article explains how to configure the control (and its parent application) in order to enable saving for large images. By default **RadImageEditor** can save images with size up to ~2MB.


## Configure the Maximum Allowed JSON Length in RadImageEditor

When **RadImageEditor** is used in enabled **CanvasMode** (which is used by default) the image inside it is loaded as a JSON string. The default max size of this string can transfer images up to about 2MB otherwise the image is not being saved properly (the image data will not be passed to the server successfully). You can increase this size by configuring the ImageEditor's **MaxJsonLength** property:

````ASP.NET
<telerik:RadImageEditor RenderMode="Lightweight" ID="RadImageEditor1" CanvasMode="Yes" runat="server" ImageUrl="~/Images/image.jpg">
    <EditableImageSettings MaxJsonLength="2147483640" />
</telerik:RadImageEditor>
````

## Configure the Maximum Allowed JSON Length for the Whole Application

You will also need to make sure that the corresponding properties for the whole application also are configured to allow requests with bigger than the default length (e.g. [maxRequestLength](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.configuration.httpruntimesection.maxrequestlength%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) and [maxJsonLength](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/bb513882%28v=vs.100%29.aspx)):

````ASP.NET
<configuration>
    <system.web>
        <httpRuntime maxRequestLength="2147483640"/>
    </system.web>
    <system.web.extensions>
        <scripting>
            <webServices>
                <jsonSerialization maxJsonLength="2147483640"/>
            </webServices>
        </scripting>
    </system.web.extensions>
</configuration>
````
