# Client-Side Events Overview





**RadImageEditor** provides a rich set of client-side events which allow easy and flexible use in a wide range of application scenarios. Many of the events are cancelable giving you the possibility to cancel any operation performed on the image:

* [OnClientLoad]({%slug imageeditor/client-side-programming/events/onclientload%}) - raised when the control is initialized.

* [OnClientCommandExecuting]({%slug imageeditor/client-side-programming/events/onclientcommandexecuting%}) - raised when the user fires a command of the control. The event can be canceled.

* [OnClientCommandExecuted]({%slug imageeditor/client-side-programming/events/onclientcommandexecuted%}) - raised after the user fires a command of the control. The event is subsequent to the [OnClientCommandExecuting]({%slug imageeditor/client-side-programming/events/onclientcommandexecuting%}) event.

* [OnClientDialogLoaded]({%slug imageeditor/client-side-programming/events/onclientdialogloaded%}) - raised when a tool widget dialog is loaded from the server.

* [OnClientImageChanging]({%slug imageeditor/client-side-programming/events/onclientimagechanging%}) - raised when the user initiates an action on the image. The event can be canceled.

* [OnClientImageLoad]({%slug imageeditor/client-side-programming/events/onclientimageload%}) - raised when the image in the editor loads in the browser.

* [OnClientImageChanged]({%slug imageeditor/client-side-programming/events/onclientimagechanged%}) - raised after the image has changed. The event is fired after [OnClientImageChanging]({%slug imageeditor/client-side-programming/events/onclientimagechanging%}) event.

* [OnClientResizeStart]({%slug imageeditor/client-side-programming/events/onclientresizestart%}) - raised when the user starts resizing the control.

* [OnClientResizeEnd]({%slug imageeditor/client-side-programming/events/onclientresizeend%}) - raised when the user has finished resizing the control.

* [OnClientSaving]({%slug imageeditor/client-side-programming/events/onclientsaving%}) - raised when the user starts saving the changes on the image. The event can be canceled.

* [OnClientSaved]({%slug imageeditor/client-side-programming/events/onclientsaved%}) - raised after the user has saved the image.

* [OnClientToolsDialogClosed]({%slug imageeditor/client-side-programming/events/onclienttoolsdialogclosed%}) - raised when the tool's dialog is closed (if opened).

* [OnClientShortCutHit]({%slug imageeditor/client-side-programming/events/onclientshortcuthit%}) - raised when a given Keyboard ShortCut of the RadImageEditor was hit. The event can be cancelled.

To use these events, simply write a javascript function that can be called when the event occurs. Then assign the name of the javascript function as the value of the the corresponding property.

````ASP.NET
<telerik:RadImageEditor RenderMode="Lightweight" runat="server" ID="RadImageEditor1" OnClientLoad="OnClientLoad"></telerik:RadImageEditor>
<script type="text/javascript">
    function OnClientLoad(sender, eventArgs)
    {
        alert("OnClientLoad event fired by RadImageEditor with ID: " + sender.get_id());
    }
</script>
````



You can also assign event handlers in client-side code. When using the client-side API, pass a reference to the event handler rather than its name. One advantage of using the client-side API is that you can attach multiple event handlers to one event using the standard MS AJAX convention:

````JavaScript
function addEvents()
{
    var radImageEditor1 = $find("<%= RadImageEditor1.ClientID%>");
    radImageEditor1.add_commandExecuting(function1);
    radImageEditor1.add_commandExecuting(function2);
}
````



Another advantage of the client-side API is that you can detach an event handler dynamically:

````JavaScript
function removeEvents()
{
    var radImageEditor1 = $find("<%= RadImageEditor1.ClientID%>");
    radImageEditor1.remove_commandExecuting(function1);
}
````
