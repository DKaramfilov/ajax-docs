# SelectedTabChange



## 

The server-side **SelectedTabChange** event occurs when non-selected tab is clicked, causing a postback.

The event handler function receives two arguments:

1. The **RadRibbonBar** which has fired the event. This argument is of type object, but can be cast to the **RadRibbonBar type**.

1. An EventArgs object has the following properties:

	* **Tab** - the currently selected tab.

	* **PreviouslySelectedTab** - the previously selected tab.

The following example demonstrates how to use the SelectedTabChange event to determine the new and the previously selected tab.



````C#
	
protected void RadRibbonBar1_SelectedTabChange(object sender, RibbonBarSelectedTabChangeEventArgs e)
{
    string message = string.Format("Tab {0} was selected.", e.Tab.Text);
    string details = string.Format("Previosly selected tab was: {0}", e.PreviouslySelectedTab.Text);

    textBox1.Text = string.Format("{0} {1}", message, details);
}
	
````
````VB.NET
	
Protected Sub RadRibbonBar1_SelectedTabChange(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As RibbonBarSelectedTabChangeEventArgs)
	Dim message As String = String.Format("Tab {0} was selected.", e.Tab.Text)
	Dim details As String = String.Format("Previosly selected tab was: {0}", e.PreviouslySelectedTab.Text)

	textBox1.Text = String.Format("{0} {1}", message, details)
End Sub
