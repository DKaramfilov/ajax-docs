# Render Modes

## 

**RadRibbonBar** has two different render modes that can change the actual HTML markup that is rendered. They are exposed via the **RenderMode** property that can have three possible values - **Classic**, **Lightweight** and **Auto**. This functionality was introduced in the **Q2 2015** version.

The possible options are:

* **Classic** - this is the default value of the **RenderMode** property. It preserves the original rendering of the control.

* **Auto** - this mode makes each control choose the appropriate rendering mode according to the used browser - **Classic** or **Lightweight**. This functionality was added in Q2 2015.

* **Lightweight** - with this render mode, the control yields different markup making maximum use of CSS 3 and semantic HTML. This means that we have dropped the image gradients in favor of CSS gradients. As for the skins, the main goal of using the **Lightweight** render mode is that image gradients could be easily replaced by CSS gradients. Thus, the amount of data that the client browser should request is sensibly decreased.

>important **RadRibbonBar**, as well as the other Telerik controls that utilize render modes, supports only one type of render mode per page. This includes mode being set for a standalone instance, and a programmatically created instance. All such controls must have the same **RenderMode** on a given page. This also includes instances from user controls and master pages.

## Setting the Render Modes

There are two ways to set the **RenderMode** for the **RadRibbonBar**:

When the **RenderMode** property is set in the markup you can type in a string, when set in the code-behind it takes a member of the Telerik.Web.UI.RenderMode enum. For example:


````ASP.NET
<telerik:RadRibbonBar RenderMode="Lightweight" runat="server" ID="RadRibbonBar1"> </telerik:RadRibbonBar>	    
````


A **global setting** in the web.config file that will affect the entire application, unless a concrete value is specified for a **RadRibbonBar** instance:

* Change render mode for all **RadRibbonBar** controls in your application:


````ASP.NET
<appSettings>
   <add key="Telerik.Web.UI.RenderMode" value="lightweight" />
</appSettings>
````


* Change render mode for all controls in your application:


````ASP.NET
<appSettings>
    <add key="Telerik.Web.UI.RibbonBar.RenderMode" value="lightweight" />
</appSettings>
````
