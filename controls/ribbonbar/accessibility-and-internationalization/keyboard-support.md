RadRibbonBar Keyboard Support

## Keyboard Support

As of Q3 2011 RadRibbonBar introduces keyboars support. The new functionality is based on the Mircosoft's Ribbon specification for keyborad navigation.

A new section for configuration is added to the RadRibbonBar. The newly added section is called **KeyboardNavigationSettings** and has three new properties:

* **Activated** : this property auto enables key hints on page load.

* **CommandKey** : used with the FocusKey to focus the RadRibbonBar. By default this property is set to use the **Alt** key, but it could be changed to something else from the following enumeration:

	1. Alt

	1. Ctrl

	1. Shift

	1. AltShift

	1. AltCtrl

	1. CtrlShift

* **FocusKey**: focus key used with the CommandKey. By default this property is set to use the **Q** key. Again there is an enumaration, so other key could be used as focus key.

For every item of the RadRibbonBar a specific access key should be set using its **AccessKey** property. Once the keyboard navigation is enabled and the control is focused, the access keys of the currently active items will be shown as hints over them:

In order to move one level up in a specific collection the **Esc** key should be used.
