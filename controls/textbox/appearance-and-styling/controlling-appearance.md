# Controlling Appearance



A number of properties let you set the look and feel of the **RadInput** controls:

* The **Skin** property lets you specify a [skin]({%slug radtextbox/appearance-and-styling/skins%}) to set the overall look and feel of the input control.

* In addition to the skin, you can [set a variety of styles]({%slug radtextbox/appearance-and-styling/styles%}) that let the input control change its appearance depending on whether it is enabled or disabled, is under the mouse, has focus, contains an empty value, or contains an invalid value.

* The **Label** property lets you [add a label]({%slug radtextbox/appearance-and-styling/adding-labels%}) to the input control.

* The **EmptyMessage** property lets you [specify a string that appears when the user has not entered a value]({%slug radtextbox/appearance-and-styling/displaying-empty-values%}).

* The **ButtonsPosition** property lets you specify the layout of any buttons associated with the input control.

* The **WrapperCssClass** property specifies the CSS class(es) added to the wrapper element of the RadInput control.

* The **LabelCssClass** property specifies the CSS class(es) added to the [label]({%slug radtextbox/appearance-and-styling/adding-labels%})	of the RadInput control.

* The **LabelWidth** property specifies the width of the [label]({%slug radtextbox/appearance-and-styling/adding-labels%})	of the RadInput control.

* The **Width** property specifies the width of the wrapper of the control. When Single Input Rendering is enabled, the default value is 160px.

In addition to the properties mentioned above, which apply to all types of **RadInput** controls, each type of control has additional properties that affect its appearance.

## RadTextBox

On the **RadTextBox** control, the **TextMode** property specifies whether the text appears in a single line or multiple lines. The **Columns**, **Rows**, and **Wrap** properties further customize the appearance of [multi-line text boxes]({%slug radtextbox/appearance-and-styling/multi-line-text-boxes%}).
