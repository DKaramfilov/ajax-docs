# OnClientEntryRemoving



## 

The **OnClientEntryRemoving** client-side event is fired when an entry is about to be removed from the Entry area.

The event handler receives two parameters:

1. The instance of the RadDropDownTree client-side object.

2. An Event argument parameter.

The event can be cancelled - simply set **args.set_cancel** to **true** - **args.set_cancel(true);** from the event handler and the entry from the dropdown will not be removed.
