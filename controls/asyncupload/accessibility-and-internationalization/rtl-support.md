# RTL Support

## 

**RadAsyncUpload** include support for right-to-left locales using the direction attribute. If you set **dir="rtl"** on the **RadAsyncUpload** or for any parent HTML element, the control reverses order of the elements and aligns itself to the right side of its container:

````ASPNET
<telerik:RadAsyncUpload RenderMode="Lightweight" id="RadAsyncUpload1" runat="server" dir="rtl" Skin="Office2007">
</telerik:RadAsyncUpload>
````

This produces the following result:
