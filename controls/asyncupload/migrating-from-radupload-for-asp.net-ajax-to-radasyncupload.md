# Migrating from RadUpload for ASP.NET AJAX to RadAsyncUpload

Since we deprecated the **RadUpload** control in June 2013 (Q2 2013), we highly recommendusing the **RadAsyncUpload** control instead. This article describes the steps that you needto take in order to migrate from RadUpload control to RadAsyncUpload.

## Migrating from RadUpload for ASP.NET AJAX to RadAsyncUpload

To migrate a web application from **RadUpload for ASP.NET AJAX** to the new **RadAsyncUpload**, you need to follow these steps:

1. Make sure that you have registered the handler's URL in the web.config. This is done by using the Smart Tag of the **RadAsyncUpload**.

1. Replace the old declaration:

	**ASP.NET**
	
		<telerik:RadUpload …></telerik:RadUpload> 
	
	with the new one:

	**ASP.NET**
	
		<telerik:RadAsyncUpload RenderMode="Lightweight" …></telerik:RadAsyncUpload> 


1. You can leave all old properties intact.

1. [*Optional*] Set the **TemporaryFolder** property. In most cases it can be any folder. There are two exceptions:

* In medium trust this must be a folder that is inside your application folder

* In a web farm environment, the **TemporaryFolder** as well as the **TargetFolder** properties must be set to folders located on a shared drive.
