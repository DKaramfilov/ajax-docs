# Styling the Input Element



This article provides information on how to alter the appearance of the control (if you need to hide the input element of the **RadAsyncUpload** and only leave the **Select** button).

## HideFileInput Property

With the release of Q3 Service Pack 2012 the **HideFileInput** property is implemented for the **RadAsyncUpload** control. When this property is set to **false** the text box in front of the button is not rendered.
