# Progress Monitoring With Ajax



## 

While uploads [cannot be done via Ajax]({%slug upload/uploading-files/uploading-files-with-ajax%}), this is not true for **custom progress measurement**. There are several scenarios in monitoring custom progress via Ajax:

1) Having RadProgressManager and RadProgressArea updated by the **RadAjaxManager/RadAjaxPanel/UpdatePanel** - RadProgressManager andRadProgressArea will be **recreated** (the progress area will flicker)when the Ajax call has finished. Due to this refresh the progress measurement (the progress-Ajax calls) will stop automatically.

2) Having only operation-specific controls, but not RadProgressManager/RadProgressArea updated(e.g. a button and a label) - RadProgressArea will not flicker when the page update finishes.However, the progress-Ajax calls will continue and the time label of the progress area will continue counting. To stop this the **RadProgressContext.Current.OperationComplete** member should be set to **True**. The progress polling will stop automatically.
