There is data in it only in the [OnTileDataBound event]({%slug tilelist/server-side-programming/server-side-events/ontiledatabound%}) of the RadTileList.|
| **EnableSelection** |bool|Whether the tile can be selected. Will not be used in the context of a RadTileList, in this case the behavior of all tiles is controlled	through the SelectionMode property of the RadTileList. Defaults to false.|
| **Height** |unit|The height of the tile. It is generally controlled by the Shape property and setting it here can break some of the	appearance/functionality ofthe control. Inherited from WebControl.|

| **NavigateUrl** |string|Gets or sets the URL of the page to navigate to, without posting the page back to the server. If AutoPostBack	for the RadTileList is true navigation will not occur.|

Values must begin with a letter in the range of a through	z (case-insensitive), except for the special values which begin with an underscore:	_blank renders the content in a new	window without frames.	_parent renders the content in the immediate frameset	parent.	_search renders the content in the search pane.	_self renders the content	in the frame with focus.	_top renders the content in the full window without	frames.	Note: check your browser documentation to determine if the _search	value is supported. For example, Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0 and later	support the _search target value.The default value is an empty string ("").Navigation is done through JavaScript and browser restrictions may apply for opening new popups (due to	popup blockers) and navigating frames in higher in the hierarchy (same-origin policy).|
