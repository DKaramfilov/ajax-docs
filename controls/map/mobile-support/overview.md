# Mobile Support Overview

**RadMap** for ASP.NET AJAX is a mobile friendly control that works on wide screens as well as on smaller screens. The control has by design a lightweight rendering that is based on the latest web technology (i.e., HTML5 and CSS3).

**RadMap** is also adapted to touch device gestures like tap, drag, spread and pinch. More information is available in [Gestures Support]({%slug map/mobile-support/gestures-support%}) help article.

To facilitate responsive web page design, **RadMap** offers [Elastic design]({%slug map/mobile-support/elastic-design%}) and [Fluid design]({%slug map/mobile-support/fluid-design%}) features.
