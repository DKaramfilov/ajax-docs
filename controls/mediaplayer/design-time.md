# Design Time



The **RadMediaPlayer** designer provides a convenient **Smart Tag** which allows easy access to frequently needed tasks. You can display it by right clicking on the control in the design window, and choosing **Show Smart Tag** from its context menu, or by simply clicking on the arrow button on top-right corner of the control.

The **RadMediaPlayer** Smart Tag lets you perform the following:

## RadMediaPlayer Tasks

* **Source** - Enables you to pick up the path to the source media file to play.

* **HDSource** - Enables you to pick up the path of the source media file to play in HD mode.

* **Poster** - Enables you to pick up the path to the poster of the media.

* **AutoPlay** - Indicates whether the media file will start playing on load.

* **StartVolume** - Controls the start volume for the media player.

* **StartTime** - Controls the start time for the media player.
