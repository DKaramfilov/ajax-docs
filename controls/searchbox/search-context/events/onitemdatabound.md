# OnItemDataBound



The following article demonstrates the usage of the server-side event **OnItemDataBound**.

## 

The **ItemDataBound** event occurs for each item that is added to the Items collection of the **SearchContext** when it is bound. This event only occurs if the items are loaded from a data source (the DataSource or DataSourceID property is set). The event handler receives two parameters:

* **The SearchContext** that is loading items. This argument is of type object, but can be cast to the SearchContext type.

* A **SearchBoxContextItemEventArgs** object. This object has an Item property, which provides access to the item that was just bound. This item has a DataItem property, which lets you access the item in the data source, to which the **SearchContextItem** is being bound.

**Example 1**: Demonstrates how to use the **ItemDataBound** event handler, in order to set the **ImageUrl** property of the **SearchContextItem**. 



````C#
	
protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
	RadSearchBox3.SearchContext.ItemDataBound += SearchContext_ItemDataBound;
}

void SearchContext_ItemDataBound(object sender, SearchBoxContextItemEventArgs e)
{
	e.Item.ImageUrl = ((DataRowView)e.Item.DataItem)["PhotoPath"].ToString();
}
	
````
````VB.NET
	
	    Protected Sub Page_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs)
	        RadSearchBox3.SearchContext.ItemDataBound += SearchContext_ItemDataBound
	    End Sub
	
	    Private Sub SearchContext_ItemDataBound(sender As Object, e As SearchBoxContextItemEventArgs)
	        e.Item.ImageUrl = DirectCast(e.Item.DataItem, DataRowView)("PhotoPath").ToString()
	
	    End Sub
