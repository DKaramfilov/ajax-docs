# Filtering Overview



##  

RadListView for ASP.NET AJAX features integrated filtering capabilities. Filtering is achieved through the definition of filter expressions which should consequently be added to the **FilterExpressions** collection of the control.

Each filter function has a corresponding type that should be used for the construction of the filter expression. If, for example, a filter expression with a *GreaterThan* logical operator is to be defined, the *RadListViewGreaterThanFilterExpression* type is there to help you build the expression. The same goes for all the other filter operators (functions).

## Building filter expressions

The filter expressions can be added to RadListView's FilterExpressions collection in several ways:

* Creating instances of the new filter expressions and adding them to the **FilterExpressions** collection.


              RadListView1.FilterExpressions.Add( new RadListViewGreaterThanFilterExpression<DateTime>("ShippedDate"){CurrentValue
              = DateTime.Parse("7/10/1996")} ); RadListView1.FilterExpressions.Add( new RadListViewEqualToFilterExpression<int>("OrderID"){CurrentValue
              = 42} );




* Using the **fluent expression builder** object which can be used to build the expressions in a more stream-lined manner. With this approach you need to remember to call the Build() method upon the expression once it is declared.


              RadListView1.FilterExpressions.BuildExpression() .GreaterThan("ShippedDate",
              DateTime.Parse("7/10/1996")) .Or().EqualTo("OrderID", 42).Build();




* The last and most consise way is provided by an overload of the FilterExpressions collection BuildExpression method which takes in as an argument an Action delegate.


              RadListView1.FilterExpressions.BuildExpression(expression => expression .GreaterThan("ShippedDate",
              DateTime.Parse("7/10/1996")) .Or().EqualTo("OrderID", 42) ) );




More information on the APIs used for these ways of filtering and some code samples can be found [here]({%slug listview/fuctionality/filtering/operating-with-radlistview-filterexpressions-manually%}).

## Grouping the filter expressions

One of RadListView's most powerful filtering features is the easy way to tie several filter expressions into one group and treat it as a single expression that can participate in further logical operations. Again a dedicated type is provided out-of-the-box to help you in this regard - the **RadListViewGroupFilterExpression**. It can be used in all of the above ways to construct filter expressions and add them to the **FilterExpressions** collection of the RadListView control. The sample filter expressions above can be extended with the group feature as follows:


          RadListView1.FilterExpressions .BuildExpression(expression => expression .GreaterThan("ShippedDate",
          DateTime.Parse("7/10/1996")) .Or().EqualTo("OrderID", 42) .And().Group(group =>
          group.IsNotEmpty("ShipCountry") .And().Contains("ShipCountry", "G") ) );

## Filtering with RadFilter

The above functionalities can also be achieved without manually building the filter expression. **RadFilter** control which provides UI and back-end for building complex filtering criteria. In most cases it is enough to assign the ID of RadListView to the **FilteredControlID** property of the RadFilter and you are ready to go. This is demonstrated in the following online demo:

For more custom scenarios (like applying expressions on custom actions, building expressions through the filter APIs, etc.) the **FireApplyCommand()** method along with the **OnApplyExpressions** event are used. RadFilter has a query provider written to produce filter queries specifically for the RadListView control - **RadFilterListViewQueryProvider**. You can use it to extract the built custom expression and assign it to RadListView. You can see a code sample on using the provider in the following help article:
