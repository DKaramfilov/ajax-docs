# Server-side Programming Overview

For a detailed list with the server-side properties and methods of the control, see the [Server-Side API of the RadListView class](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/api/server/Telerik.Web.UI/RadListView).

Following are tables of the most important properties and event you should be aware of when working with **RadListView**.

## Properties


|  **Property**  |  **Description**  |
| ------ | ------ |
| **AllowCustomPaging** |Gets or sets a value that indicates whether custom paging is enabled.|
| **AllowCustomSorting** |Gets or sets a value that indicates whether custom sorting is enabled.|
| **AllowMultiFieldSorting** |Gets or sets the value indicating whether more than one column can be sorted in a single **RadListView** . The order is the same as the sequence of expressions in SortExpressions.|
| **AllowMultiItemEdit** |Gets or sets a value indicating whether Telerik **RadListView** will allow you to have multiple items in edit mode. The default value is **false** .|
| **AllowMultiItemSelection** |Gets or sets a value indicating whether Telerik **RadListView** will allow you to select multiple items. By default this property is set to **false** .|
| **AllowNaturalSort** |When the property is set to **true** the no-sort state when changing sort order is allowed. Set it to **false** to force only two-way sorting (ascending and descending).|
| **AllowPaging** |Gets or sets a value indicating whether the paging feature is enabled.|
| **CanRetrieveAllData** |Gets or sets a value indicating whether Telerik **RadListView** should retrieve all data and ignore server paging in case of filtering or grouping.|
| **InsertItemPosition** |Gets or sets the position of the InsertItemTemplate template when RadListView is in insert mode. The possible values are: **None** , **FirstItem** , **LastItem** .|
| **ItemPlaceholderID** |Gets or sets the ID for the item placeholder in a **RadListView** control.|
| **OverrideDataSourceControlSorting** |When the property is set to true, the **RadListView** control will sort internally instead of the DataSourceControl.|
| **SortExpressions** |Add or remove objects to this collection to set sorting programmatically.|
| **VirtualItemCount** |Gets or sets a value, indicating the total number of items in the data source when custom paging is used. Thus RadListView "understands" that the data source contains the specified number of records and it should fetch merely part of them at a time to execute requested operation.|
| **ClientSettings.AllowItemsDragDrop** |Gets or sets a value, indicating if Items Drag & Drop in RadListView capability is enabled.|
