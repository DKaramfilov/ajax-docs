# Empty Values

>caution  **RadChart** has been replaced by [RadHtmlChart](https://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax/html-chart.aspx), Telerik's client-side charting component. If you are considering **RadChart** for new development, examine the [RadHtmlChart documentation]({%slug htmlchart/overview%}) and [online demos](https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/htmlchart/examples/overview/defaultcs.aspx) first to see if it will fit your development needs. If you are already using **RadChart** in your projects, you can migrate to **RadHtmlChart** by following these articles: [Migrating Series]({%slug htmlchart/changes-and-backwards-compatibility/migrating-from-radchart-to-radhtmlchart/migrate-series-configuration%}), [Migrating Axes]({%slug htmlchart/changes-and-backwards-compatibility/migrating-from-radchart-to-radhtmlchart/migrate-axes-configuration%}), [Migrating Date Axes]({%slug htmlchart/changes-and-backwards-compatibility/migrating-from-radchart-to-radhtmlchart/migrate-date-axis-configuration%}), [Migrating Databinding]({%slug htmlchart/changes-and-backwards-compatibility/migrating-from-radchart-to-radhtmlchart/migrate-data-binding-configuration%}), [Features parity]({%slug htmlchart/changes-and-backwards-compatibility/migrating-from-radchart-to-radhtmlchart/migrate-functionalities---features-and-series-types-parity%}). Support for **RadChart** is discontinued as of **Q3 2014**, but the control will remain in the assembly so it can still be used. We encourage you to use **RadHtmlChart** for new development.

RadChart automatically approximates missing values between known data points, simply by setting the **Empty** property true on any chart series item. This works for bar, line and area based chart types. You also have complete control over the visual style of empty values. The empty value style can be articulated separately from the style for the main values.
