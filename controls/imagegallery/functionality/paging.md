# Paging


RadImageGallery has built-in paging mechanism that you can use to optimise performance. When paging is enabled only the images for the current page are loaded. That can make a considerable difference especially when working with a lot of images.

In order to enable paging you need to set the **AllowPaging** property for the control to **true**. Furthermore, you can specify the page size via the **PageSize** property.


````ASP.NET
<telerik:RadImageGallery runat="server" ID="RadImageGallery1" ImagesFolderPath="~/Images" Width="600px" 
    AllowPaging="true" PageSize="5">
</telerik:RadImageGallery>
````
