# Mobile Support Overview



**Telerik ASP.NET Image Gallery** comes with built-in **responsive** behavior. When accessed via a mobile device,the control changes its appearance to better fit the device screen size. A sample demonstration of the mobile capabilities of the control can be observed [here](https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/image-gallery/examples/mobile-and-touch-support/responsive-behavior/defaultcs.aspx). For optimal experience on mobile devices, we suggest that you use **Telerik** controls together with the [Page Layout Framework](https://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax/responsive-page-layout.aspx), which will add responsive capabilities to your layout.
