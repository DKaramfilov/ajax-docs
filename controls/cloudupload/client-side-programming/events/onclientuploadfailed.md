# OnClientUploadFailed



## 

The **OnClientFileUploadFailed** client-side event occurs when an error has occured, while uploading the selected file. Common reason for this event to be fired is when a file upload has failed due to a server-side error.

The event handler receives two parameters:

1. The instance of the **RadCloudUpload** control firing the event.

2. An **eventArgs** parameter containing the following method:

* **get_message** returns the original error message.

One useful case for using this event is to check the error message.

````ASP.NET
<telerik:RadCloudUpload runat="server" ID="RadCloudUpload1" OnClientUploadFailed="onClientUploadFailed">
</telerik:RadCloudUpload>
````



````JavaScript
function onClientUploadFailed(sender, eventArgs) {
	alert(eventArgs.get_message())
}
````
