# HTML Output



RadTreeList is designed to display tabular data in a table-based layout. The HTML output of the control looks like this:

````XML
<div class="RadTreeList RadTreeList_Default">
	<table class="rtlTable rtlHVBorders rtlHBorders rtlVBorders rtlLines" cellspacing="0">
		<colgroup>
			<col style="width: 23px;" />
			<col style="width: 23px;" />
			<col />
			<col />
			<col />
		</colgroup>
		<thead>
			<tr class="rtlHeader">
				<th colspan="3" class="rtlCF">
					Column 1
				</th>
				<th>
					Column 2
				</th>
				<th class="rtlCL">
					Column 3
				</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>

* **div.RadTreeList.RadTreelist_SkinName** - the control's wrapper, which holds the skin name. By default it is a block-level element with a border, so setting 100% width to the control is both unnecessary and causes content overflow by amount of the left and right border widths. If the **ShowOuterBorders** property is set to "false", then a **RadTreeListNoBorder** CSS class is appended as well.

* **table.rtlTable** - the control's data container with a number of columns and rows, according to the datasource or control configuration. It contains a \<thead\> element with the header row, a \<tbody\> element with the data rows and a \<colgroup\> element with \<cols\> which may define column widths. Depending on the values of the control's **GridLines** and **ShowTreeLines** properties, the \<table\> element may receive also the following CSS classes: **rtlHBorders**(GridLines="Horizontal" or "Both"), **rtlVBorders**(GridLines="Vertical" or "Both"), **rtlHVBorders**(GridLines="Both") and **rtlLines**(ShowTreeLines="true"). The \<table\> element always renders a cellspacing="0" attribute. The expand/collapse columns are always 23px wide.

* **tr.rtlHeader** - the header row. If sorting is enabled, the header cells contain \<a\> elements instead of plain text nodes. The sort indicators are represented by **input.rtlSortAsc** and **input.rtlSortDesc** elements/classes

* data row CSS classes (all start with "rtlR", except the rtlA class):

	* **tr.rtlR** - odd (normal) rows

	* **tr.rtlA** - even (alternating) rows

	* **tr.rtlRSel** - selected rows

	* **tr.rtlROut** - applied to the first row following a row from a lower (nested) level of hierarchy

	* **tr.rtlRL** - applied to the last row from a given level of hierarchy, when a next row exists and is from an outer level

	* **tr.rtlRBtm** - applied to the last row (on the current page) of the control

* data cell CSS classes (all start with "rtlC")

	* **td.rtlCF** - the first data cell in a row

	* **td.rtlCL** - the last data cell in a row. If there is a single column, its cells have both CSS classes

* CSS classes related to treelines and expand/collapse behavior

	* **td.rtlL**- applied to all cells, which are not data cells (i.e. the ones that contain treelines, expand/collapse buttons, or neither of these)

	* **td.rtlL0**- applied to cells, which contain a single vertical treeline connecting two rows at the same level, with the upper row currently being expanded

	* **td.rtlL1** - applied to the first cell from the first row from the first page, when it is expanded

	* **td.rtlL2** - applied to cells which contain a T-shaped treeline (i.e. there are same-level rows above and below the current row)

	* **td.rtlL3**- applied to cells which contain an L-shaped treeline (these cells belong to the last rows at a given level)

	* **input.rtlExpand** - applied to the expand buttons, which are \<input type="button" /\> elements

	* **input.rtlCollapse** - applied to the collapse buttons, which are \<input type="button" /\> elements

If paging is enabled, the pager controls are placed inside a **tr.rtlPager** element.

In RTL mode the RadTreeList wrapper has a couple of additional CSS classes, namely - **RadTreeListRTL** and **RadTreeListRTL_SkinName**.

## Notes on RadTreeList Skinning

* The control's \<table\> element should have a **border-collapse:separate** and **table-layout:fixed** CSS styles applied. These are located in the base stylesheet.

* The control's base stylesheet contains all border-width and border-style CSS styles that are needed. You can only specify border-color in your custom skin.

* RadTreeList skins use the RadGrid sprite image for the header, row and pager styles. If you will be creating a custom RadTreeList skin, based on an existing skin, make sure you also take the RadGrid sprite image and place it in a location accessible by the RadTreeList CSS file.
