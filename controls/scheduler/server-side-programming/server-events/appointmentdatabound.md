# AppointmentDataBound



The **AppointmentDataBound** event occurs when an appointment has been added to the Appointmentscollection from the data source.

**AppointmentDataBound** has two parameters:

* **sender** is the scheduler control.

* **e** is an object of type **SchedulerEventArgs**. It has an Appointment property that lets you access the appointment that was just loaded.

You can use this event to make adjustments to the appointments as they are loaded.

## Example





````C#
	
protected void RadScheduler1_AppointmentDataBound(object sender, SchedulerEventArgs e)
{
	e.Appointment.Start = e.Appointment.Start.AddHours(1);
} 
	
````
````VB.NET
	
Protected Sub RadScheduler1_AppointmentDataBound(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As SchedulerEventArgs) Handles RadScheduler1.AppointmentDataBound
	e.Appointment.Start = e.Appointment.Start.AddHours(1)
End Sub
