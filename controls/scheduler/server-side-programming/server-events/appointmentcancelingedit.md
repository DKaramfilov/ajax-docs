# AppointmentCancelingEdit



The **AppointmentCancelingEdit** event occurs when the user clicks the cancel button of the in-line editor or the edit form.

**AppointmentCancelingEdit** has two parameters:

* **sender** is the scheduler control.

* **e** is an object of type **AppointmentCancelingEditEventArgs**. It has three properties:

* **Appointment** is the appointment that was being inserted or updated by the editor.

* **Container** is the editor that was being used to insert or edit an appointment.

* **Cancel** is a boolean value that lets you prevent the user from exiting the edit form or in-line editor.
