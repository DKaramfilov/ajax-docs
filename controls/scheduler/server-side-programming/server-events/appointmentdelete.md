# AppointmentDelete



The **AppointmentDelete** event occurs just before the scheduler calls its data source to delete an appointment.

**AppointmentDelete** has two parameters:

* **sender** is the scheduler control.

* **e** is an object of type **SchedulerCancelEventArgs**. It has two properties:

* **Appointment** is the appointment that is about to be deleted.

* **Cancel** is a boolean value that lets you prevent the deletion.

## Example





````C#
	
protected void RadScheduler1_AppointmentDelete(object sender, SchedulerCancelEventArgs e)
{
	if (e.Appointment.Attributes["ReadOnly"] == "true")
	{
		e.Cancel = true;
	}
} 
	
````
````VB.NET
	
Protected Sub RadScheduler1_AppointmentDelete(ByVal sender As Object, _
   ByVal e As SchedulerCancelEventArgs) Handles RadScheduelr1.AppointmentDelete
	If e.Appointment.Attributes("ReadOnly") = "true" Then
		e.Cancel = True
	End If
End Sub
	
````
