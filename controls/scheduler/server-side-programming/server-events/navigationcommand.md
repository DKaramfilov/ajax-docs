# NavigationCommand



The **NavigationCommand** occurs when the user clicks on a control that changes the selected day, view, or mode of the scheduler.

**NavigationCommand** has two parameters:

* **sender** is the scheduler control.

* **e** is an object of type **SchedulerNavigationCommandEventArgs**. It has three properties:

* **Command** indicates what control the user clicked. Possible values are listed in the table below.

* **SelectedDay** is a DateTime specifying the target date when **Command** is **SchedulerNavigationCommand.SwitchToSelectedDay**.

* **Cancel** is a boolean value that lets you prevent the scheduler from responding to the navigation command.

The **Command** property is of type **SchedulerNavigationCommand**. This type has the following possible values:
