# OnClientAppointmentWebServiceDeleting



## 

If specified, the **OnClientAppointmentWebServiceDeleting** client-side event handler is called when an appointment is about to be deleted via Web Service call. In the case of server-side binding, the event will not be raised.

Two parameters are passed to the handler:

* **sender** - the scheduler client object;

* **eventArgs** with three properties:

	* **get_appointment()** - the appointment that is about to be deleted.

	* **get_editingRecurringSeries**() - indicates whether the recurring series are being deleted.

	* **set_cancel()** - set to true cancel the operation.

This event can be cancelled.
