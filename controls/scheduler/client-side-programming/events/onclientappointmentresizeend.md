# OnClientAppointmentResizeEnd



The **OnClientAppointmentResizeEnd** client-side event is called when the user releases the mouse after resizing an appointment.

Two parameters are passed to the event handler:

* **sender** is the scheduler client object.

* **eventArgs** has the following methods:

* **get_appointment()** returns the appointment instance.

* **get_editingRecurringSeries()** returns **True** ifthe user is trying to delete a series to which the appointment belongs, **False** if the user is tryingto delete a single occurrence of an appointment.

* **get_newStartTime()** returns the new start time of the appointment if user has resized the upper part of the appointment - the appointment start time.

* **get_newEndTime()** returns the new end time of the appointment if user has resized the bottom part of the appointment - the appointment end time.

* **get_targetSlot()** returns the instance of the time slot that the appointment has been resized to.

* **set_cancel()**lets you permit or block the resize of the appointment. Calling **set_cancel(true)** cancels the resize,while **set_cancel(false)** allows the scheduler to proceed with updating the appointment to reflect the resize.

## Example

This example cancels the resize if the user tried to resize an appointment's series:

````ASPNET

<script type="text/javascript">   
function OnClientAppointmentResizeEnd(sender, eventArgs)
{                                  
	  if(eventArgs.get_editingRecurringSeries())
		   eventArgs.set_cancel(true);
	  else
		  alert("Appointment start time: " + eventArgs.get_newStartTime() + ", Appointment end time: " + eventArgs.get_newEndTime());
}

</script>
