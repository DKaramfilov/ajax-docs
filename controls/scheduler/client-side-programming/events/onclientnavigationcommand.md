# OnClientNavigationCommand



## 

If specified, the **OnClientNavigationCommand** client-side event handler is called when the scheduleris about to execute a navigation command. In the case of server-side binding, the event will not be raised.

Two parameters are passed to the handler:

* **sender** - the scheduler client object;

* **eventArgs** with three properties:

	* **get_command()** - the navigation command that is being processed.

	* **get_selectedDate()** - the date that RadScheduler will navigate to.

	* **set_cancel()** - set to true to cancel the operation.

This event can be cancelled.
