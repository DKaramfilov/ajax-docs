# Events Overview



## 

**RadScheduler** has a number of properties which value is the name of a JavaScript function that executes when specific client-side events occur. These events are listed below:

* **[OnClientFormCreated]({%slug scheduler/client-side-programming/events/onclientformcreated%})** - occurs when an in-line editor or edit form is about to appear.



Web Service binding specific events:

* **[OnClientAppointmentsPopulating]({%slug scheduler/client-side-programming/events/onclientappointmentspopulating%})** - occurs when the scheduler is about to request appointments.

* **[OnClientAppointmentsPopulated]({%slug scheduler/client-side-programming/events/onclientappointmentspopulated%})** - occurs when the scheduler has received appointments from the Web Service.

* **[OnClientAppointmentDataBound]({%slug scheduler/client-side-programming/events/onclientappointmentdatabound%})** - occurs when an appointment is received and is about to be rendered.

* [OnClientAppointmentSerialized]({%slug scheduler/client-side-programming/events/onclientappointmentserialized%}) - allows you to populate appointments with custom data before sending them to the Web Service

* **[OnClientAppointmentCreated]({%slug scheduler/client-side-programming/events/onclientappointmentcreated%})** - occurs when an appointment is received and has been rendered.

* **[OnClientResourcesPopulating]({%slug scheduler/client-side-programming/events/onclientresourcespopulating%})** - occurs when the scheduler is about to request resources.

* **[OnClientResourcesPopulated]({%slug scheduler/client-side-programming/events/onclientresourcespopulated%})** - occurs when the scheduler has received resources.

* **[OnClientDataBound]({%slug scheduler/client-side-programming/events/onclientdatabound%})** - occurs when the scheduler has been populated with data.

* **[OnClientRequestFailed]({%slug scheduler/client-side-programming/events/onclientrequestfailed%})** - occurs when a request to the Web Service has failed.

* **[OnClientRequestSuccess]({%slug scheduler/client-side-programming/events/onclientrequestsuccess%})** -occurs when when a request to the Web Service has succeeded.

* **[OnClientAppointmentWebServiceInserting]({%slug scheduler/client-side-programming/events/onclientappointmentwebserviceinserting%})** - occurs when an appointment is about to be stored via Web Service call.

* **[OnClientAppointmentWebServiceDeleting]({%slug scheduler/client-side-programming/events/onclientappointmentwebservicedeleting%})** - occurs when an appointment is about to be deleted via Web Service call.

* **[OnClientAppointmentWebServiceUpdating]({%slug scheduler/client-side-programming/events/onclientappointmentwebserviceupdating%})** - occurs when an appointment is about to be updated via Web Service call.

* **[OnClientRecurrenceExceptionCreating]({%slug scheduler/client-side-programming/events/onclientrecurrenceexceptioncreating%})** - occurs when a recurrence exception is about to be created via Web Service call.

* **[OnClientRecurrenceExceptionsRemoving]({%slug scheduler/client-side-programming/events/onclientrecurrenceexceptionsremoving%})** - occurs when recurrence exceptions are about to be removed via Web Service call.



Reminder related events:

* [OnClientReminderTriggering]({%slug scheduler/client-side-programming/events/onclientremindertriggering%}) -occurs when an appointment reminder is due and is about to be triggered.

* [OnClientReminderSnoozing ]({%slug scheduler/client-side-programming/events/onclientremindersnoozing-%}) - occurs when an appointment reminder is due and is about to be snoozed.

* [OnClientReminderDismissing ]({%slug scheduler/client-side-programming/events/onclientreminderdismissing-%}) - occurs when an appointment reminder is due and is about to be dismissed.



To use these events, simply write a JavaScript function that can be called when the event occurs. Then assign the name of the JavaScript function as the value of the the corresponding **RadScheduler** property.

````JavaScript
	     
<script type="text/javascript">   
  function OnClientAppointmentInserting(sender, eventArgs)
  {
	 var now = new Date();
	 if (eventArgs.get_startTime() < now)
		 eventArgs.set_cancel(true);
  }
</script>
	
	// #region client-side-programming-events_1
	
function onClickHandler1()
{
	alert("First handler occurs");
}
function onClickHandler2()
{
	alert("Second handler occurs");
}
function pageLoad()
{
	 var Scheduler = $find("<%= RadScheduler1.ClientID %>");
	 
	 Scheduler.add_timeSlotClick(OnClickHandler1);
	 Scheduler.add_timeSlotClick(OnClickHandler2);
}      
	
````



You can also assign event handlers in client-side code. When using the client-side API, pass a reference to the event handler rather than its name. One advantage of using the client-side API is that you can attach multiple event handlers to one event using the standard MS AJAX convention:

````JavaScript
	
function onClickHandler1()
{
	alert("First handler occurs");
}
function onClickHandler2()
{
	alert("Second handler occurs");
}
function pageLoad()
{
	 var Scheduler = $find("<%= RadScheduler1.ClientID %>");
	 
	 Scheduler.add_timeSlotClick(OnClickHandler1);
	 Scheduler.add_timeSlotClick(OnClickHandler2);
}      
	
````



Another advantage of the client-side API is that you can detach an event handler dynamically:

````JavaScript
	
function removeOnClick2()
{
	 var Scheduler = $find("<%= RadScheduler1.ClientID %>");
	 Scheduler.remove_timeSlotClick(OnClickHandler2);
}       
	
````



Note that on the client-side, the names of events are slightly different than on the server-side. The following table shows the correspondence between client-side and server-side names:
