# OnClientAppointmentClick



The **OnClientAppointmentClick** client-side event is called when the user clicks on an appointment with the mouse.

Two parameters are passed to the event handler:

* **sender** is the scheduler client object.

* **eventArgs** has one method - **get_appointment()** that returns the appointment instance.

## Example

````ASPNET
	
<script type="text/javascript">   
function OnClientAppointmentClick(sender, eventArgs)
{
	var apt = eventArgs.get_appointment();
	alert("You clicked on an appointment with the subject: " + apt.get_subject());
}
</script>
