# Reading the Recurrence Rule



## 

The recurrence rule is incomplete without the start and end date of the first occurrence.

You need to set them to the **StartDate** and **EndDate** properties before retrieving the recurrence rule.

The following example builds the recurrence rule by reading the Start and End date from two **RadDatePickers** on the page:

````C#
	     
	
protected void SaveButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{    
	RecurrenceEditor1.StartDate = StartDate.SelectedDate.Value;    
	RecurrenceEditor1.EndDate = EndDate.SelectedDate.Value;
	// Read the recurrence rule    RecurrenceRule rrule = RecurrenceEditor1.RecurrenceRule;
	// Or directly as string    string rruleText = RecurrenceEditor1.RecurrenceRuleText;
}
				
````
````VB.NET
	     
	
Protected Sub SaveButton_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
	RecurrenceEditor1.StartDate = StartDate.SelectedDate.Value
	RecurrenceEditor1.EndDate = EndDate.SelectedDate.Value
	' Read the recurrence rule Dim rrule As RecurrenceRule = RecurrenceEditor1.RecurrenceRule
	' Or directly as string Dim rruleText As String = RecurrenceEditor1.RecurrenceRuleTextEnd Sub
End Sub
