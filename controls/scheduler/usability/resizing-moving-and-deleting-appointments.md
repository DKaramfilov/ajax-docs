# Resizing Moving and Deleting Appointments



You can make simple changes to the appointments that **RadScheduler** displays without bringing up the edit form or in-line editor.

Starting Q1 2013 SP1 users have the ability to resize appointments horizontally in Week and Multi-day view.

## Resizing Appointments

To change the duration of an appointment, select the grabber at the bottom of the appointment and pull it up or down to resize the appointment.![Grabber](images/scheduler_grabber.PNG)

The appointment is automatically updated to reflect the new duration. If you attempt to resize a recurring appointment, the **"Resizing a recurring appointment"** popup appears, so that you can indicate whether the new duration applies to the single occurrence or to the entire series:![Resize Occurence](images/scheduler_resizeoccurrence.png)

## Moving Appointments

You can move appointments by dragging them on the desired timeslot and dropping them. If you attempt to move a recurring appointment it becomes an exception. However you can customize whether the edit applies to the single occurrence or to the entire series by setting the **DisplayRecurrenceActionDialogOnMove** property to **“True”**. The **"Moving a recurring appointment"** popup appears:

## Deleting Appointments

All appointments can be deleted by clicking on the icon in the top right corner which appears on hover of the appointment:

![Delete Appointment](images/scheduler_deleteappointment.png)

After clicking on the icon the **“Delete confirmation”** popup appears so that you can cancel the operation if the icon is clicked by mistake:

![Delete Recurring Appointment](images/scheduler_deleterecurringappointment.png)

You can prevent the appearance of this popup by setting the DisplayDeleteConfirmation property to **“False”**. If you attempt to delete a recurring appointment, the **"Deleting a recurring appointment"** popup appears, so that you can indicate whether to delete the single occurrence or the entire series:
