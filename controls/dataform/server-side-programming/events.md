## 

The ASP.NET page framework provides a technique called event bubbling that allows a child control to propagate events up its containment hierarchy.Event bubbling enables events to be raised from a more convenient location in the controls hierarchy and allows event handlers to be attached to theoriginal control as well as to the control that exposes the bubbled event.

When an event bubbles from a child control, **RadDataForm** will fire **ItemCommand** event. A child control(such as a Button server control) raises a bubble event if you set any value in **CommandName** property.

Here is a list of the available command names in Telerik RadDataForm:


| Command Name | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| **Page** |Fired when the PageSize property is set and changed.|
| **Edit** |Represents the Edit command name. Fires **RadDataForm.EditCommand** event.|
| **Update** |Represents the Update command name. Fires **RadDataForm.UpdateCommand** event.|
| **Cancel** |Represents the Cancel command name. Fires **RadDataForm.CancelCommand** event.|
| **Delete** |Represents the Delete command name. Fires **RadDataForm.DeleteCommand** event.|
| **InitInsert** |Opens the insert item. Fires **RadDataForm.InitInsertCommand** event.|
| **PerformInsert** |This command perform automatic insert operation and close the insert item. Fires **RadDataForm.PerformInsertCommand** event.|
| **Rebind** |Rebind **RadDataForm** control and forces **RadGrid.Rebind** event.|
