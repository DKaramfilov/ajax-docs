# Disable AJAX when Client Browser Does Not Support it



## 

Telerik RadAjax controls won't work in browsers that do not support [XmlHttpRequests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest). You may want to disable AJAX when such a browser opens your site. To disable AJAX, you can set the **EnableAJAX** property of Telerik **RadAjaxManager** or **RadAjaxPanel** control to **false** both on client- and server-side.

The .NET 2.0 framework provides the **SupportsXmlHttp** property and it should be used to check if the browser supports **XmlHttpRequest** :



````C#
	
RadAjaxPanel1.EnableAJAX = Page.Request.Browser.SupportsXmlHttp;
	
````
````VB
	
RadAjaxPanel1.EnableAJAX = Page.Request.Browser.SupportsXmlHttp
	
````


When this check is made in the **Page_Load** event handler, it will make your page work as if it was in a standard postback scenario for those browsers.

>caution Some browsers do support **XmlHttpRequests** and still return **false** for the **SupportsXmlHttp** property.In such cases, you should define Browser definition files. You can find more info in the links below.
