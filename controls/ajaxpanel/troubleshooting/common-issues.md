# Common Issues



Here are some of the common issues one can face when using **RadAjax** .

* [Inline JavaScript in dynamically loaded user controls is missing on the page.](#Problem1)

* [A control’s skin is not loaded after an AJAX update.](#Problem2)

* [Setting the EventName property in the AJAX settings for the AJAX initiator control does not work.](#Problem3)

* [The loading panel is not displayed if you invoke multiple requests from the same AJAX initiator before the previous request finished.](#Problem4)

* [My page went blank after I fired an event from a dynamically loaded user control.](#Problem5)

* [After postback/AJAX request, my control does not keep its last state.](#Problem6)

* [After dynamically loading a user control, I cannot fire the events of any of its controls.](#Problem7)

* [LoadingPanel is not displayed when dynamically created controls in a user control trigger the AJAXrequest.](#Problem8)

* [I used RadAjax to AJAX-enable controls but they are showing up twice.](#Problem9)

* [UseSubmitBehavior for ASP Button is ignored when the control is AJAX enabled through RadAjaxManager or RadAjaxPanel](#Problem10)

## 

1. Problem: Inline JavaScript in dynamically loaded user controls is missing on the page.Solution: Wrap your script block into a **RadScriptBlock**. If the issue persists in your case, you ought to register the script through the **ScriptManager.RegisterStartupScript()** method.

````ASPNET	
<telerik:RadScriptBlock Id="RadScriptBlock1" runat="server">
	<script type="text/javascript">
		//your code here
	</script>
</telerik:RadScriptBlock>
````		  	


````C#	
protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
	ScriptManager.RegisterStartupScript(Page, typeof(Page), "dynamicScript", "function doSomething(){alert(1);}");
}
````
````VB
Protected Sub Page_Load(sender as Object, e as EventArgs) Handles Me.Load
	 ScriptManager.RegisterStartupScript(Page, Page.GetType(), "dynamicScript", "function doSomething(){alert(1);}")
End Sub
````


2. Problem: A control’s skin is not loaded after an AJAX update.Solution: This issue usually occurs when a control is displayed after an AJAX update or the skin is changed upon AJAX update. In this case, set the control’s **EnableAjaxSkinRendering** property to **true** on **Page_Load** and after every postback

````C#	
protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
		RadCalendar1.EnableAjaxSkinRendering = true;
}
````
````VB
Protected Sub Page_Load(sender as Object, e as EventArgs) Handles Me.Load
	RadCalendar1.EnableAjaxSkinRendring = true
End Sub
````


For example, if a **RadGrid** control is shown after a partial postback from a button click the	**EnableAjaxSkinRendering** property of **RadGrid** should be set to **true**	on button click. Also, keep in mind that if there are controls inside the grid, their **EnableAjaxSkinRendering**property should also be set to **true**. The code snippet below demonstrates how to load the skins of	**RadGrid** and **RadDateTimePicker** control placed in the **ItemTemplate** of the grid template column after a partial postback.

````C#	
protected void Button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
        RadGrid1.Visible = true;
        ((RadGrid1.MasterTableView.Items[0] as GridDataItem)["TemplateColumnUniqueName"].FindControl("RadDateTimePicker1") as RadDateTimePicker).Calendar.EnableAjaxSkinRendering = true;
        ((RadGrid1.MasterTableView.Items[0] as GridDataItem)["TemplateColumnUniqueName"].FindControl("RadDateTimePicker1") as RadDateTimePicker).TimeView.EnableAjaxSkinRendering = true;
        ((RadGrid1.MasterTableView.Items[0] as GridDataItem)["TemplateColumnUniqueName"].FindControl("RadDateTimePicker1") as RadDateTimePicker).DateInput.EnableAjaxSkinRendering = true;
        RadGrid1.EnableAjaxSkinRendering = true;
}
````
````VB
Protected Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click.
	    RadGrid1.Visible = True
	    TryCast(TryCast(RadGrid1.MasterTableView.Items(0), GridDataItem)("TemplateColumnUniqueName").FindControl("RadDateTimePicker1"), RadDateTimePicker).Calendar.EnableAjaxSkinRendering = True
	    TryCast(TryCast(RadGrid1.MasterTableView.Items(0), GridDataItem)("TemplateColumnUniqueName").FindControl("RadDateTimePicker1"), RadDateTimePicker).TimeView.EnableAjaxSkinRendering = True
	    TryCast(TryCast(RadGrid1.MasterTableView.Items(0), GridDataItem)("TemplateColumnUniqueName").FindControl("RadDateTimePicker1"), RadDateTimePicker).DateInput.EnableAjaxSkinRendering = True
	    RadGrid1.EnableAjaxSkinRendering = True
End Sub
````



3. Problem: Setting the **EventName** property in the AJAX settings for the AJAX initiator control does not work.Solution: The **EventName** property is obsolete for **RadAjax** . If your logic strongly relies on it, you should use an **asp:UpdatePanel** toAJAX-enable the controls instead of **RadAjax** . Another option is to wrap the updated control in a**RadAjaxPanel** instead of using the **RadAjaxManager** to AJAX-enable it. Then on certain client-side events of the AJAX initiator, invoke AJAX for the corresponding **RadAjaxPanel** manually. See the sample in[this help article]({%slug ajaxpanel/overview%}) for more information.

4. Problem: The loading panel is not displayed if you invoke multiple requests from the same AJAX initiator before the previous request finished.Solution: Modify your code to handle the **RadAjaxManager/RadAjaxPanel OnRequestStart** client-side event.

````JavaScript
<telerik:RadCodeBlock ID="RadCodeBlock1" runat="server"> 
    <script type="text/javascript"> 
        function RequstStart() { 
            var obj = Sys.WebForms.PageRequestManager.getInstance(); 
            if (obj.get_isInAsyncPostBack()) 
            obj.abortPostBack();
        	} 
    </script> 
</telerik:RadCodeBlock>
````



5. Problem: My page went blank after I fired an event from a dynamically loaded user control.Solution: This can happen if user controls were improperly loaded. When loading user controls,you need to have two things in mind:

* Always recreate the last loaded user control on **Page_Init/Page_Load** .

* Assign unique IDs to the loaded controls.If the page goes blank, check if the control is always recreated. For more information about how to load user controls dynamically,please refer to [this]({%slug ajaxpanel/how-to/load-user-controls%}) topic.

6. Problem: After postback/AJAX request, my control does not keep its last state.Solution: This can happen if you are loading user controls and you do not assign unique IDs to them.In this case, the framework will generate an automatic ID which can be different than the original ID and therefore the ViewState is being lost.This is the cause for losing the last state of the control.

7. Problem: After dynamically loading a user control, I cannot fire the events of any of its controls.Solution: This is caused by improper loading of the user controls. If the control is persisted on the page, but its events are not fired, check to see if you have assigned an ID to this control. This is required by the framework to preserve theViewState and handle the control events.

8. Problem: I have a user control that is populated with dynamically created controls. After I have AJAX-enabled the user control with **RadAjaxPanel(RadAjaxManager)**, the loading panel I have specified does not display at all when any of the dynamically created controls triggers the AJAX request (though the AJAX request itself is completed successfully and the content is updated).Solution: The most likely reason for this behavior is missing ID for the dynamically created controls.Please make sure you are assigning an ID to the controls and you should experience no further problems.

9. Problem: I used **RadAjax** to AJAX-enable controls but they are showing up twice.Solution: This can happen if you have added controls to the Page controls collection dynamically on**Page.Render** and the page is AJAX-enabled through **RadAjax**. The control, is rendering twice because **RadAjax** is calling the **Render** method twice in order to achieve partial rendering.The additional call of the method is for rendering the AJAX-enabled controls only. However, note that the page itself is rendered once.Therefore, you should add controls earlier in the **Page** life cycle.

10. Problem: **UseSubmitBehavior** for **ASP Button** is ignored when the control is AJAX enabled through **RadAjaxManager** or **RadAjaxPanel** .When you enable AJAX for **ASP Button** through **RadAjaxManager** or **RadAjaxPanel** ,the **UseSubmitBehavior** property of the button is internally set to **false** ,which causes the input element rendered for the button to always be set to "**button** ".
