# OnInitialize

The client-side **Initialize** event is raised when the **RadProgressBar** client-side object is initialized. This article	discusses the objects of the control's **Initialize** event and shows	an example of how to retrieve properties when the event occurs (**Example 1**).

To handle this event, simply write a JavaScript function that can be called when the event occurs. Then assign the name of this function as the	value of the the **OnInitialize** property in the control's **ClientEvents** subtag.

The client-side **OnInitialize** event handler receives one argument:

1. Senderâ€”the [RadProgressBar object]({%slug progressbar/client-side-programming/radprogressbar-object%}) that fired the event.
