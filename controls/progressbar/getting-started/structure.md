### Progress Indicator

The progress indicator is a bar that is filled as an operation progresses (by default from the left to the right). Depending on the value passed to the progress barâ€™s **BarType** property, the current progress status can be displayed as [percent or value]({%slug progressbar/functionality/types%}).

### Progress Label

This is the label that displays the level of process completion. The built-in progress label is supported only when the control is used in [Percent or Value]({%slug progressbar/functionality/types%}) mode .

### Chunks

The chunks represent the equal pieces in which the progress bar can be divided. They illustrate the completed steps from a quantitative process.
