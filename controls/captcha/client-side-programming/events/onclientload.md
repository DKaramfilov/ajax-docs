# OnClientLoad

The **OnClientLoad** event is raised when the RadCaptcha object is initialized. It can notify the developer that the control is available (e.g. to store a reference to its client-side object for later use).

The event handler receives two arguments:

1. the RadCaptcha object that fired the event

1. an empty event arguments object
