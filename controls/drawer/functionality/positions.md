# Positions

**RadDrawer** can be configured via the `Position` property to show up from two directions: 

- `left` _(default)_

- `right`

>note This configuration is applied for both the `Overlay` and `Push` modes. When `Mini mode` is enabled, the position property is ignored and is considered as `left`.
